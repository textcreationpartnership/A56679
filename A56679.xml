            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe Meditations being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and born in your Houſe, I take it to be a piece of Juſtice that they ſhould lay themſelves at your feet, and come abroad into the world under your Name. (And long before this, had they come to tender their ſervice to you, had the Preſs been favourable to them, and not let them ſtick longer there than they did in my mind, before they could be brought forth into the world.) Love hath as great a power to make ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as any thing elſe, and no bondman
<pb facs="tcp:31853:3"/>is faſter chained than he that is tied by the bands of his own affection. A Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that quality I muſt needs profeſs my ſelf, having ſuch a feeling of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations you have laid upon me, that I am not free to love you, or not to love you; but am held under ſuch a ſweet tyranny, that I cannot ſo much as deſire to recover my former liberty. Theſe thoughts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being the births of one ſo bound to ſerve you, both by your favours and his own affections;<note place="margin">Exod. 21.4.</note> according to the Law of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> you may challenge a right <hi>in them,</hi> ſeeing I am yours as much as my own. I know that I am writing <hi>to</hi> you, and not <hi>of</hi> you; and that you do not expect my commendation, but my Counſel; for if you did, you would not deſerve Commendation. There is ſo much flattery many times in theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, that men will not believe us when we ſay true, and ſo we diſpleaſe while we ſtudy to pleaſe. The world likewiſe is ſo envious, that they never think more of our faults, than when we are praiſed. But yet to tell you of your kindneſs to me, though you do not expect it, methinks I might be allowed, were it not that then I ſhould commend my ſelf for a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:31853:3"/>Perſon, after I have declined to commend you. But ſeeing that is no ſuch great vertue that a man ſhould be tempted to be proud of it, I ſhall ſay thus much: That of all the cauſes that are uſually aſsigned of theſe Dedications, I can find the impulſe of none ſo ſtrong as that of love and gratitude. Which bids me bind my executors by theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents (if theſe Papers can live longer than I) to acknowledge your love, and ever be mindfull of it to you and yours. And although I may juſtly ſuſpect that they have not ſtrength enough to live to any great Age; yet if they can increaſe your Piety but in the leaſt degree, that is a thing that never dies, and will be an immortal witneſs of my endeavours to ſerve you. To the ſtudy of that it is, that I do moſt affectionately exhort you. Do well, and you ſhall hear well, though mine and all other Pens lie aſleep. Piety is the trueſt and moſt Ancient Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as wickedneſs is the greateſt and baſeſt degeneracy. There is no ſuch way to exalt your Family, as to make a ſtrict alliance with God, and to draw him into your kindred. Nothing can ſo enrich your Bloud, as to contract
<pb facs="tcp:31853:4"/>an affinity with the Blood of Jeſus. But if earthly honour be of any value (as it may conduce to the better ſerving of God) you have the favour granted unto you to be noble both in your ſoul and body, to be allied both to the Bloud of God, and of great Men. The <hi>Saint</hi> in your name, may put you in mind to be Saints in your ſelves. The two <hi>Mullets</hi> or <hi>Stars</hi> in your Coat of Armes, bids you ſhine like <hi>two Lights</hi> in the World. The occaſion of your bearing them (which if I miſtake not, was becauſe your Progenitors warred in the <hi>Holy Land</hi>) may put you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to ſtrive and fight to be made free of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that City of God that is above. As theſe Stars were born in their Enſigns in that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in oppoſition to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent; ſo let them put you in mind to keep the world ſtill under your feet, and to ſcorn theſe mutable and moon-like things,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:31853:4"/>retires out of the Channel. It will be a moſt lovely ſight both to God and Man, to ſee you humble and lowly in the higheſt tides of a ſwelling fortune; and if your fulneſs ſhould abate and draw back into the Ocean from whence it came, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the elevation of your ſpirit, and the greatneſs of your mind riſing above all the reach of theſe worldly changes. Then would you moſt truly imitate thoſe <hi>Stars</hi> in your Eſcutchion, which are not ſeen in the day; and ſhine moſt brightly in the night.</p>
            <p>But your name bids you above all things to be full of love both to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and towards all men.<note place="margin">

            <p>GOd who is ſimple and removed far from all ſenſe, conſidering the weakneſs of mans ſoul, and how unable

This Son of his, being to die, and part with his life for great ends and purpoſes, which he would not have us to forget; was pleaſed to take the ſame courſe to convey to our minds ſpiritual notions by outward and ſenſible ſigns; and to impreſs on our hearts what he hath done and ſuffered, by a viſible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of it in bodily things, and not onely by a plain deſcription of it in the Goſpel. He knew very well that a Picture and Image of a thing doth more affect us than an Hiſtorical Narration; and that the more lively and expreſs that Image is, the more lively motions it makes within us. A dead Corpſe is but the ſhadow of a man, and yet we find that our ſouls are more aſſaulted, and all our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtirred by the ſight of the face of a
<pb facs="tcp:31853:7"/>dead friend, then by all the reports that are brought us of his death. And long after his Corpſe is mouldred in the Grave, if we ſee a Child of his that hath his exact features, manners, and carriage, it renews a freſh remembrance in us of that perſon, and ſtirs up the Images that are in our mind more powerfully, then we can do our ſelves by reflections upon them.</p>
            <p>But though God was willing to teach us by outward and ſenſible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> yet he thought it both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, and likewiſe unfit, and no ways conducing to the ſpiritual ends he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Sacrament of Chriſts body and bloud, that we ſhould have a picture of Chriſt, or an Image of him ſet before our eyes. There is too much of ſenſe in the Tragical and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrical repreſentations which are made by ſome Papiſts of Chriſts ſufferings. The outward actions are in danger not onely to take place of all ſpiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but quite to thruſt them out. The eye and the ear are ſo fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, that their objects work by their own natural ſtrength, and not by the ſouls conſidering and meditating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<pb facs="tcp:31853:8"/>Our Saviour therefore, that he might both help the ſoul, and leave it ſomething for to do in making of its own thoughts, and forming its own apprehenſions and reſentments, hath given us onely Bread and Wine as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of him: in which we ſee ſo much as to awaken our ſouls, but not ſo much as to keep them awake without themſelves. They ſhow Chriſt to our ſences, but more to our minds; that ſo both may be employed, but the mind may do moſt by the help of the ſenſes.</p>
            <p>And indeed theſe are very fit things (upon other reaſons) to ſerve our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours deſign,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, They are ſimiliar bodies, and not conſiſting of Heterogenious parts, <hi>i. e.</hi> their parts are not of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds, as the parts of our fleſh are. The fleſh of a man is compoſed of veins, and arteries, and nerves, and blood, and muſcles, and divers skins; but every part of Bread and Wine is like the other, and hath nothing in it different from its neighbour. Every piece of the one, and every drop of the other, doth as much repreſent
<pb facs="tcp:31853:8"/>what is intended, as any other part doth; and all the parts together make one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the very ſame ſort.</p>
            <p>And yet ſecondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The parts of theſe bodies are eaſily ſeparated one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which makes them more fit to be communicated and divided among a great many, who all notwithſtanding do receive (as it were) the very ſame thing.</p>
            <p>And thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> They are conſtantly uſed at all feaſts, and never omitted, whereas other things have their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and cannot do continual ſervice at our Tables.</p>
            <p>To which you may add fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That they were brought by <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck</hi> unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a part (perhaps) of the bleſſing of that High Prieſt, and as a ſignification of that Sacrament which God would have <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed to feed upon, when the true High Prieſt after that great mans order ſhould come.</p>
            <p>And fifthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It is not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that they do beſt anſwer to ſome things whereunto Chriſt is compared in the holy Scriptures. For he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Vine,</hi> and <hi>every branch that is
<pb facs="tcp:31853:9"/>in him,</hi> muſt bring forth <hi>fruit,</hi> as he doth, which may hereby be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And he is called <hi>the Bread of life, which came down from Heaven,</hi> as the <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wilderneſs, who is to ſupport our ſouls, as the ſtaff of bread doth our bodies.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But it is moſt to be remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that theſe were part of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-Supper, when Chriſt (as <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſpeaks) was typically eaten in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> For firſt, It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, that the <hi>Bread</hi> was bleſſed, and the <hi>Cup</hi> alſo, and ſo went round to all the gueſts: And the forms of Benediction are ſtill extant in ſome of the Hebrew Authors. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The whole Feaſt after the Paſſeover-night, was called <hi>the Feaſt of unleavened Bread.</hi> And thirdly, It is the opinion (I obſerve) of ſome, that our Saviour at the time of inſtituting this Sacrament,<note place="margin">Grot.</note> did eat onely the Bread, and the bitter Herbs, but not the Lamb of the Paſſeover. For it is not ſaid in the Evangeliſts, that his Diſciples <hi>killed</hi> the Paſſeover for him, but onely that they <hi>made ready</hi> the Paſſeover, which might be nothing
<pb facs="tcp:31853:9"/>elſe but that bread of affliction, and the herbs which were attended with the cup of kindneſs that uſed to paſs among them. For our Saviour died at the time the Paſſeover-Lamb was offered, being indeed the Lamb of God himſelf. And therefore S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. That the Supper was before the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, and he calls it eating of the Paſſeover, becauſe this was a great part of it, a principal portion of this Feaſt. And this part was all that they could par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, who at any time could not come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where only the Lamb was to be eaten, being firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at the Temple. But ſuppoſing this to be doubtful, yet there is no queſtion but that this Lamb was a Type of Chriſt; and that Bread and Wine was a part of their Supper. And upon ſearch, I believe we ſhall find, that the Lamb of the Paſſeover was the only Sacrifice which the people did wholly eat (its blood being pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out at the Altar) and it doth the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſet forth Chriſt who gives himſelf wholly to us. To which, fourthly, may be added, that as the Paſchal-Lamb
<pb facs="tcp:31853:10"/>did repreſent him, ſo the manner of its killing was very conformable to Chriſts death upon the Croſs; which may make it more reaſonable to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the Supper reſemblances of him. For they hung the Lamb upon nails (much what as Butchers now do a Sheep which they have killed) and then fley'd off its skin that it might be dreſſed. While it hung in this poſture, it was juſt like the ſcituation of Chriſts body upon the Croſs, (as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> hath obſerved out of the <hi>Talmud</hi>) whoſe hands were ſo ſpread, and leggs ſo ſtretched out, as the Lamb was. 5. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which I may add, That the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not to be wholly deſtroyed, but to be changed and altered by Chriſt: So the Apoſtle teacheth us to ſpeak, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. And the malice of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s accuſers could prompt them to ſay no worſe of him, then <hi>that he preached Jeſus ſhould change the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms which Moſes delivered,</hi> Act. 6.14. Circumciſion is commanded under the title of an everlaſting Covenant, and it is not ſo much aboliſhed, as impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into a better Sacrament, and ſeal of greater bleſſings to Mankind. The
<pb facs="tcp:31853:10"/>Sabbath-day likewiſe was to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Gods reſt from all his works on the ſeventh day, and of his deliverance of them out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and it is not cancelled, but changed into another day which contains the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſomething elſe, even a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Reſurrection of our Lord from the dead, that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his reſt. So we may conceive, that this great Feaſt of the Paſſeover was not quite done away, but gave place to a better Feaſt, which is in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a greater deliverance than that from the thraldom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the iron Furnace. In this the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians might ſtill commemorate their ancient mercies, as well as if they had eaten of the fleſh of their Lamb. Yea, becauſe there was in it ſuch a clear repreſentation of Chriſts ſufferings (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in its firſt Inſtitution, when the blood was ſprinkled on the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts) part of it was thought fit ſtill to remain, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bread and Wine, which they uſed to eat and drink in memory of that mercy, with ſolemn forms of thankſgiving unto God. And laſtly, The <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> was more fit then
<pb facs="tcp:31853:11"/>the <hi>fleſh</hi> to be retained, becauſe now that Chriſt is come, all Sacrifices are to ceaſe, and no more blood is to be ſhed for fin. This, I ſay, may be a good reaſon why Bread and Wine only are uſed, becauſe they are unbloody things; and after the killing of the Lamb of God, there is to be no more life offered for our offences.</p>
            <p>This Feaſt our Saviour did firſt of all celebrate with his twelve Diſciples.<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> And it was but fit that he ſhould do ſo, that he might the better anſwer to the Type, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. where we read that <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Prieſt, with his ſons, was to eat the breaſt and ſhoulder of the Ram of conſecration, whereby he was ſanctified to officiate in the Prieſthood. Even ſo our Lord being to be offered up in Sacrifice, and thereby to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated an high Prieſt, did inſtitute this Supper, that together with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he might (as much as is poſſible) feaſt with them upon that Sacrifice. And ſeeing our Saviours Sacrifice anſwered both to the Paſchal Lamb, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice on the day of Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be no wonder if it were ſo compleat as to have reference to this alſo.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:31853:11"/>
            <p>The time when it was firſt inſtituted was in the night when he was betrayed, (for at the Even they celebrated the Paſſeover) which makes ſome (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to keep the memory of Chriſts death in the cloſe of the day. But if they think that they muſt exactly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that precedent, they ſhould do it after Supper. And I rather think that the manner of receiving about noon is moſt agreeable to the true pattern. For we do not remember the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> but his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on the Croſs. And therefore as the <hi>Jews</hi> feaſted at Even, becauſe they came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> at that time; ſo ſhould we feaſt about Noon, becauſe our Lords death began between nine and twelve, and ended about three of the Clock, as you will clearly ſee by comparing the relation of S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> together. It is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 19.14. that it was about the ſixth hour, when Chriſt was condemned to be crucified. But S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeaks of his ſentence, and of the execution of it, as things done before the ſixth hour, and ſaith (<hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 33.) That juſt when the ſixth hour was come, then darkneſs ſpread over all the Land,
<pb facs="tcp:31853:12"/>till the ninth hour. They do very well agree, if we do but underſtand thus much; that the day being divided into four equal parts, conſiſting of three hours apiece; every part had the name of that hour when it did begin; and ſo the ſixth hour was from twelve to three, and then began the ninth hour. Now S. <hi>John</hi> doth not ſay, that it was the ſixth hour when <hi>Pilate</hi> gave him up to be crucified, but that it was <hi>about the ſixth hour,</hi> i. e. it was between nine a clock (which was their third hour) and twelve, but nearer to twelve than to nine; or it drew near to Noon; yet not ſo near, but that we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low time for the leading him away to the Croſs, for the hanging him thereon, and the reſt. In ſo much that S. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>That it was but the third hour,</hi> i. e. nine of the clock, when thoſe things were done. Both of them ſay true, if we do but conceive that it was between nine and twelve, <hi>i. e.</hi> about half an hour after ten, when our Lord was hanged on the Croſs. All the time between nine and twelve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called (as I ſaid) the third hour, <hi>S. Mark</hi> ſaith, that that was the time:
<pb facs="tcp:31853:12"/>But it drawing toward twelve, S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, it was <hi>about the ſixth hour.</hi> And when the ſixth hour was fully come, <hi>i. e.</hi> when it was juſt twelve a clock, and the Sun was in its Meridian, then (ſaith S. <hi>Mark</hi>) was it eclipſed, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs continued till three, which was the time of the offering of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice, and juſt then our Lord expired, and gave up the Ghoſt. From whence we may clearly gather, That our Saviour was in the very midſt of his ſufferings a little, after twelve. Which renders it unreaſonable, me thinks, to innovate and forſake the common form by receiving towards night, ſeeing our Saviour was in the middle and bitterneſs of his paſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Noon (which is the common time of our Communions) and his paſſion was quite finiſhed a good while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, wherein ſome do cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate it.</p>
            <p>But I do not intend that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhould beget any quarrels, and therefore I forbear the proſecution of any ſuch obſervations, which you muſt not expect to meet withal in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: The firſt deſign of which is to
<pb facs="tcp:31853:13"/>ſhew you for what end our Bleſſed Lord did appoint this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>And here I might be tempted to make uſe of that method which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a little Diſcourſe concerning Baptiſm,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> for that which is done here, is but a further confirmation of what was then agreed on between God and us. As our knowledge and obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, ſo doth likewiſe the Favour of God, and his teſtimonies of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: and the more his mercies are aſſured unto us, the more are we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and confirmed in our reſolution of perſiſting in obedience. So that it is but one and the ſame thing that is thus frequently ratified, firſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and afterward in Confirmation, and laſtly in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. For there in the moſt ſolemn manner that can be deviſed, we profeſs our ſelves foederates of God, and he again owns us for his friends, and treats us kindly by entertaining us at his own Table. And this is no ſtrange matter, that one thing ſhould be ſo often repeated; for at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Friendſhip between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> he only made him a promiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:31853:13"/>(<hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3.) <hi>That he would make him a great Nation, and bleſs him, and all thoſe that bleſſed him, and that all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth ſhould be bleſſed in him.</hi> But in proceſs of time, when love was encreaſed between them, this <hi>Promiſe</hi> became a <hi>Covenant,</hi> when he and his received the token of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2, 4, 5. <hi>I will make my Covenant between me and thee, and will multiplie thee exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,</hi> &amp;c. But when he had walked longer with God, (as he there bids him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.) and had perfected his obedience by offering up his Son, his onely Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> then God confirmed the Covenant by an <hi>Oath,</hi> and ſware by himſelf, that he would do what he had promiſed and ſealed; as you may ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, 17, 18. <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn, that in bleſsing I will bleſs thee, &amp;c.</hi> This may be conceived as a good repreſentation of Gods dealing with us now. At our firſt entrance into his family he gives us many promiſes which depend upon conditions; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he renews the Covenant with us, and doth further aſcertain us of his favour, yet on terms of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
<pb facs="tcp:31853:14"/>and at laſt he ſwears unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, when we have given proof of our obedience to him, that he will not take away his mercies, nor his loving kindneſs from us. And it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in every one of theſe, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſomething to <hi>Abraham</hi> for what he gave to God. When he left his own Countrey, he promiſed him the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> When he was circumciſed, he promiſed to bleſs his ſeed, yea, he promiſed to him the <hi>Meſsiah:</hi> And when he offered <hi>Iſaac,</hi> God again aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by oath, that his own Son ſhould be really offered, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was deſigned to be, for a Bleſſing to all the Earth. Even ſo, in like manner, doth God confer new graces and bleſſings on us when we are baptized, and when we confirm our Vows, and when we partake of the Supper of the Lord; ſo that it is not in vain reiterate our acts of ſurrender unto God. And thus it is among our ſelves, when children are contracted in their younger years, and made ſure to each other; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate the Marriage, by their own conſent, when they are of age, with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival joys: And many of theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb facs="tcp:31853:14"/>perſons likewiſe renew the nuptial ſolemnity every year, and obſerve that day that they entred into ſuch holy bonds with more than ordinary chear. Whereby they ſtrengthen their faith unto each other by an open profeſſion of their faith in the ſight of their friends, and they indear their hearts unto each other by a remembrance of their promiſes, and they run more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately into cloſer imbraces by theſe new expreſſions of kindneſs. Thus do we at this Sacrament but tie the old bond with a faſter knot; and preſs harder upon the former zeal to make a deeper mark, and a fairer Image of God in our hearts; we do but renew our Covenant which we have already made, ſwear moſt ſolemnly, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it upon the Sacrament (as we ſay) that we will be the ſervants of the Lord Jeſus. And it is very eaſie to lead you through all the parts of the former me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, ſhewing you both how on our part, and Gods, it doth confirm a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between us.</p>
            <p>And perhaps it will not be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to give ſome brief touches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe things,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> which you can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:31853:15"/>trouble inlarge in your own thoughts. Which is one reaſon why I ſhall ſpare my ſelf any long pains about them, and hold another courſe in this following Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>For our part, we do here profeſs our ſelves of the Religion that Chriſt hath inſtituted and taught us, as you will ſee more largely in the enſuing Book. We do at once in this Feaſt both ſhew our gladneſs, and aſſure him of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>Sin is here repreſented ſo unto us, that it cannot but make our wounds bleed afreſh. The remembrance of Chriſts death doth pierce our hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with godly ſorrow, and revives the ſmart and pain which the ſenſe of ſin hath created in our ſouls.</p>
            <p>Faith likewiſe here is as greedy of its food, as an hungry mouth is of its meat. And Obedience is hereby confirmed, becauſe we receive lively nouriſhment into our ſouls, which will make us ſtrong to execute the will of our Lord. Our ſuffering alſo with Chriſt, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs more lively than by <hi>Water,</hi> even by <hi>Blood</hi> it ſelf. When our Saviour ſaith in the ſixth of S. <hi>John, That we
<pb facs="tcp:31853:15"/>muſt eat of his fleſh,</hi> he means, we muſt receive himſelf, and digeſt his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but ſeeing the word <hi>fleſh</hi> in Scripture-phraſe ſignifies very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently weakneſs and meanneſs, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that we muſt receive him ſo as to partake with him in his poor, low and ſuffering condition. And this we do moſt notably proteſt that we will, when we receive the ſigns of his broken body. For the <hi>Bread broken</hi> doth not only argue it to be fit for food, but that firſt we muſt be ſlain and mortified, and likewiſe receive ſuch ſtrength, that if he call us unto death, we muſt undergo it. We own hereby the Covenant of ſufferings, and feed upon a dead Saviour. Which makes <hi>Theophylact</hi> give this as a reaſon why Chriſt gave thanks when he brake the bread, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>That ſo we might receive Martyrdom thankfully.</hi> It is a feaſt which we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, and yet ſignifies ſufferings. But let it not ſeem ſtrange, for we muſt count it all joy when we fall into divers tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it leſs ſignifie and ſeal on <hi>Gods part,</hi> being a manifeſt token
<pb facs="tcp:31853:16"/>of his great and inexpreſſible love, in giving of his own Son to death, even to the curſed death of the Croſs for us. Here he takes us not only under his wings (as, I ſaid, he doth in Baptiſm) but he takes us into his armes. He takes us to himſelf, and he gives himſelf wholly unto us.</p>
            <p>And then for <hi>Remiſsion of ſins,</hi> it is manifeſt to be the purchaſe of his blood, and ſo muſt needs further here be aſſured to all good ſouls. And it is the very thing that is expreſſed in the Inſtitution of this Sacrament: <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament that is ſhed for many, for the remiſsion of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are not ſo many ſpirits contained in the Wine, as there are lively influences of Gods good Spirit hereby conveyed to pious hearts. We have aſſurance likewiſe given by theſe things, <hi>That he will not take his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from us,</hi> but that he will let it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diffuſe it ſelf through all our powers.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Reſurrection from the dead;</hi> We being made, as it were, of his fleſh, and of his bone, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into him, he can loſe none of
<pb facs="tcp:31853:16"/>his members; but all that eat of his fleſh, and drink of his blood, as they ought, ſhall be raiſed again at the laſt day. We eat of the tree of life, which will make us live for ever; and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:31853:17"/>of Heaven, and the joys to come, as will be made more manifeſt in the following Diſcourſe. And thus far we may grant the Bread and Wine of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> to have been Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that they were given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as earneſts, for to ſecure him of the Land flowing with milk and honey. By this Banquet or Entertainment which the Royal Prieſt made him, he took <hi>Livery of Seiſin</hi> (as our Lawyers ſpeak) of the promiſed Land. And in that very place (it is moſt likely) where God intended the Mother-City of the Kingdom ſhould be, was this convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed. This Bread and Wine were moſt certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that his Poſterity ſhould eat of the fruit of that Land wherein now he was a ſtranger. And juſt in the ſame manner doth God give unto faithful ſouls this bleſſed Bread and Wine, as an Antepaſt of his eternal love; and hereby they do begin to taſte of the heavenly Feaſt that they ſhall cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate above.

And all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, were very greedy to taſte of this Cup, that the ſame Grace which he called down, might ſhowre it ſelf upon them likewiſe. I can little doubt, but that this Cup, over which he gave thanks, was a counterfeit of that which the ſound Chriſtians drunk of, from whom theſe men were apoſtatized.

            <p>But let them believe as much as they will, ſo they will but quietly ſuffer us to believe as we ſee cauſe. Let them
<pb facs="tcp:31853:20"/>practiſe as they pleaſe, if it will do them any good; we doubt not but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practiſe enough to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of as great benefits as they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. I confeſs I cannot be angry with them for believing more than I can do; but I deſire they would not be angry at us (but rather pity us) that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend our faith ſo far. If a man will ſay that Snow is nothing but fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen milk, which drops from the skies, much good may it do him with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; only let him not impoſe the ſame belief on others who intend not to trouble him for his fancy. And if they will believe that wine is the very Blood of Chriſt, I deſire not that they ſhould ſuffer the leaſt harm for this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but let them not damn us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we will not put out our eyes, and deny our taſte, and abandon our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the holy Scripture, to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel fancies and interpretations, that they obtrude upon us. I know that if a mans ſoul be not made of ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but conſiſts of weak and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous principles, they will fearfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh it with the diſmal names of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Schiſme,</hi> and ſuch like bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb facs="tcp:31853:20"/>words, which every one applies as he pleaſes. But conſiderate ſouls are grown wiſer than to be affrighted out of their wits by the noiſe of words (the great engine of this Age) and they know that damnation doth not depend upon mens mouths; for if it did, I know not who ſhould go to Heaven. We cannot be ſo blind as not to ſee, that every party arrogates to it ſelf the glorious names of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and if we would be led by ſounds, we muſt believe, no body knows, how many Chriſts. The name of Heretick, Schiſmatick, yea, and of Antichriſt and <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſignifie but little to us, who hear them every day, ſo careleſly applied, that we are aſſured men know not what they ſay. Neither will we be amazed with ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the miſerable ends of thoſe who have contemned their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for we do not allow that any man ſhould irreverently behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards any of Chriſts inſtitutions, though there be ſomething of mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention mixed with it.

We know upon what eaſie terms men may go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as they believe; and they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perſwade us that they whoſe hearts are full of God, and have his Image ſhining fairly in their ſouls, ſhall be the companions of the Devils and accurſed ſpirits; when (as they imagine) men
<pb facs="tcp:31853:22"/>of ſoul lives may get poſſeſſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and live with Saints.</p>

               </gap>, without all light, and black as the night. This ſeems to me to be but a corruption of the Story of <hi>Jonah,</hi> which might well be known to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and eaſily applied to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi> For it is obſerved by <hi>D.

Now it hath been the manner of the world to attribute all ſtrange things, that were done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to ſome one perſon famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; as all witty ſtories and jeſts are at this day fathered upon him, that is moſt noted by us to abound with them; and ſo they might eaſily tell this ſtory of their <hi>Hercules,</hi> when it was once noiſed among them, becauſe they aſcribed all wonders and miracles to him.</p>

Theſe two ſtories are but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of two in the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jeptha</hi>'s Daughter, which they have jumbled together.

Some Prieſts he ſaith in <hi>Lydia</hi> (who worſhipped after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner) uſed to call upon he knew not what God, in a barbarous form of words not to be underſtood by the Greeks, and preſently the wood that was upon the Altar was kindled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fire, and appeared all in a
<pb facs="tcp:31853:28"/>bright flame.

            <p>And indeed the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> did therefore call for fire from Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Sacrifices at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were conſumed and eaten onely by the Holy fire which God ſent from above to them. The Devil therefore in this thing may have ſeemed to endeavour that his Offerings might ſometimes correſpond with thoſe at the Temple of God.

                  <hi>The Garments that are caſt about our Saviour;</hi> and it being the profeſſion of Divines, to labour to ſee the naked face of truth; it is moſt worthy our pains, to open and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal thoſe ſecrets that lie hid and vailed under ſymbols and ſenſible things.</p>
               <p>And to ſay the truth, theſe Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo thin and tranſparent, that the truth doth ſhine through them, and ſhew it ſelf to well-prepared minds. They are but like to thoſe thin clouds wherein the Sun is ſometimes wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, which render its body the more viſible to our weak and trembling eyes.</p>
               <p>I cannot pretend to have converſed much with barefac'd truth, yet having
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31853:34"/>been drawn to publiſh a few thoughts concerning Baptiſm, I ſhall now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endeavour to unfold thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that lie hid under the coverings of bread broken, and wine poured out, in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that men may not (<hi>Ixion</hi>-like) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a meer cloud inſtead of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>My ſight is not ſo ſharp as to diſcern the very fleſh and blood of Chriſt in thoſe forms and ſhapes of bread and wine; no more could that Eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed Author I mentioned, though he thought he could ſee as far as the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Hierarchy, which will appear to any one that ſhall be at the pains to read him. Yet I am ſo far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are meer ſigns of what Chriſt did for us, or onely repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the benefits we receive by him, but am perſwaded that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit our Lord himſelf unto believing minds, and put them into a ſurer poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of him.</p>
               <p>The truth commonly lies between two extreams, and being a peaceable thing, cannot join it ſelf with either of the directly oppoſite parties. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31853:34"/>therefore I ſhall ſeek for her in a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle path, not bidding ſuch a defiance to the <hi>corporeal</hi> preſence, as to deny the <hi>real;</hi> nor ſo ſubverting the fancy of a miraculous changed into a coeleſtial <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> as to level theſe things into meer <hi>ſhadows.</hi>

                  <p>FIrſt then this holy rite of eating bread broken, and drinking wine poured out, <hi>is a ſolemn commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt,</hi> according as he himſelf ſaith to all his Apoſtles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. and particularly to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who twice makes mention of this command,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.24, 25.</note>

Now this is done by making a ſolemn rehearſal of his famous Acts, and declaring the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31853:35"/>mable greatneſs of his royal love. For <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> doth not ſignifie barely <hi>recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio,</hi> recording or regiſtring of his favours in our mind; but <hi>commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> a ſolemn declaration that we do well bear them in our hearts, and will continue the memory, and ſpread the fame of him as far, and as long as ever we are able.</p>
                  <p>I hope that none will conceive ſo little to be meant by this word, <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> or <hi>commemorate,</hi> as a naked mention of his Name with our mouthes, or a dead image of him in our minds. For all theſe words, to <hi>know, believe, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, remember,</hi> and the like, are hearty words, and full of life. Though they ſeem to ſpeak only <hi>actions of the mind,</hi> yet in holy language they include in their comprehenſion <hi>the affections of the heart.</hi> Cold, pale thoughts which have no feeling of themſelves, nor leave any footſteps or memorials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, are as good as none at all. And therefore I underſtand hereby a very warm ſence in the ſoul, which begets and ſtirs up ſuch motions in the heart as the conceived object is apt for to raiſe.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:31853:35"/>
                  <p>Suppoſe you have been in deep love with any perſon, and have loſt the half of your ſelves, when you remember the death of that friend, the image of him is ready to rob you of your lives, and make all the blood retire to your heart, as if death were about to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the main Fort of life. But on the contrary, if you think of that perſon as alive, the remembrance of him makes your ſpirits for to dance, and the blood to run into your cheeks, and ſmiles to ſit on your forehead, and breeds a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance in your whole man. Juſt ſo would our Saviour be remembred by you, that the thoughts of him may even kill you with grief, and tranſport you with love, and captivate your wills, and ingage all your affections, that they may be at his command, and iſſued forth at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As you think of a friend, of a father, of a wife or a husband, or any one that hath got the poſſeſſion of your heart, ſo think of him.</p>
                  <p>By which examples you may ſee, that I intend not a natural paſſion, and a ſenſual commotion in the ſoul, but a well-grounded affection.</p>
                  <p>When we read a true Hiſtory, or a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31853:36"/>Romance, we are apt to ſide with ſome perſons in the ſtory; and when we meet with a Duel, we favour one of the Combatants, and are ſenſible of his wounds, and ſorry for his fall, as on the contrary we are glad he comes off a conquerour and wins the field. So may a man when he thinks of Chriſt and his Tragedy, conceive a natural ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and indignation at the treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the vile malice of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and be much moved to ſee him uſed in ſuch an unworthy manner; it may be fetch ſighs from his heart, and tears from his eyes, and put him into ſuch a huge paſſion as if he ſuffered with him. But if all this have non effect in his life, and produce no anſwerable fruits afterward, it is no more than a natural motion, and is void of the divine and heavenly ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>We muſt remember Chriſt therefore, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> deſires God to remember him, by doing good: or as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our Creator, by a true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of all our faculties to his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign will.</p>
                  <p>Then we remember him as we ought, when we get him formed in our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31853:36"/>hearts, and have a more living image of him left in our minds; when it ſtirs and is buſie in our ſouls, and awakens all other images, and calls up all divine truths that are within us, to ſend them forth upon their ſeveral imployments into our lives.</p>
                  <p>Now for the fuller underſtanding of this matter, you muſt know that the Paſchal Supper (which is called by <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> very elegantly, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a more obſcure type of this type) was inſtituted for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and was a Feaſt of commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as will ſoon appear if you look but a while into the particulars of it. And firſt you muſt obſerve that the very day of the Paſſeover was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for a <hi>memorial</hi> of their miraculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as you may read <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.14. and therefore they are bid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.3. <hi>to remember</hi> this day in which they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the houſe of bondage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thence it was that they were commanded to eat the Lamb with bitter herbs (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8.) for a <hi>remembrance</hi> of their hard bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which made their lives bitter unto them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.14. So
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31853:37"/>was the unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, in remembrance that they brought their bread out of <hi>Egypt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.34.) and were there in great ſervitude (<hi>Exod.</hi> 13.3.) ſo that their ſoul was even dried and parched in them. The later Jews have added the <hi>charóſeth,</hi> which is a thick ſawce, in <hi>memory</hi> of the clay and morter which they wrought in; and they uſe <hi>red wine</hi> for <hi>a remembrance</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhed the blood of their children. To which may be added, that God required there ſhould be a rehearſal to their children of what the Lord had done for them, that ſo this feaſt might be for a ſign upon their hand, and for a memorial between their eyes to all poſterity, as you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.8, 9. And thence it is that the <hi>Jews</hi> call that ſection of the Law, or the Leſſon which they read that night, the <hi>Haggádah,</hi> annunciation or ſhewing forth, becauſe they commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and predicated both their hard ſervices, and Gods wonderful ſalvation, and the praiſes that were due to him for ſo great a mercy.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie now to apply all this to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31853:37"/>our preſent purpoſe, if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that this likewiſe is a holy feaſt. Whence it is called the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> (not only becauſe he appointed it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20.</note> but becauſe he was the end of its celebration) and an entertainment at the <hi>table of the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.21.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Feaſt our Saviour firſt keeping with his Apoſtles who were <hi>Jews,</hi> he makes part of the Paſſeover-chear to be the proviſion of it. For he takes the bread and wine, which uſed to go about in that Supper through the whole family, to ſignifie his broken body, and his blood which was to be ſhed. Now this was to be in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of a deliverance wrought by him, from a greater tyranny then the Iſraelites were under, which made all the world to groan, and was ready to thruſt us all below into the Devils fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery furnace. And therefore, as it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.8. thou ſhalt <hi>ſhew</hi> thy ſon in that day, ſaying, This is done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Apoſtle (in a manifeſt alluſion to that phraſe) ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cer. 11.26.</note> that when we eat this bread, and drink this cup, we do <hi>ſhew</hi> forth the Lords death until he come. So that we may conclude, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31853:38"/>in this feaſt in honour of Chriſt, we are to make a rehearſal of his famous acts, to proclaim his mighty deeds, to ſpeak of the glorious honour of his Majeſty, and of his wondrous works, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that one generation may praiſe his works to another,<note place="margin">Pſl. 146.3, 4, &amp;c.</note> and declare his mighty acts, that they may ſpeak of the glory of his Kingdom, and talk of his power.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it ſhould ſeem, that the memory of a thing is by nothing ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly preſerved, and ſo deeply ingraven in mens minds, as by feaſts and feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val joys. For it hath been the way of all the world, to ſend to poſterity the memory of their benefactors or famous perſons, by inſtituting of ſuch ſolemn times, wherein men did aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together, and by the joys and pleaſures of them, more imprint the kindneſſes and noble atchievements of ſuch Worthies in their minds. So we find among the Greeks their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in honour of <hi>Aeacus,</hi> their <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and ſuch like, in remembrance of the merits of ſuch perſons. and how highly they deſerved of the places
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31853:38"/>where their feaſts were celebrated. In like ſort the <hi>Jews</hi> had their feaſts in memory of ſome great and rare paſſage of divine providence, though not of any particular perſons, leſt they ſhould be tempted to worſhip them as their <hi>Saviours,</hi> according as the cuſtom of the heathen was. But all worſhip being due to our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> he thought fit in like manner to appoint this feaſt to be as a Paſſeover unto us, a holy ſolemnity that ſhould call us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and aſſemble us in one body, that we might be more ſenſibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with him, and that all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might call him bleſſed, and he might never be forgotten to the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>Now of <hi>two things</hi> it is a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and <hi>two ways</hi> we do comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate or remember them;</p>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:31853:39"/>do confute <hi>Marcion,</hi> who denied the truth of Chriſts fleſh, and made his body to be a phantaſtical thing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then real bread and wine could not be a figure of it: and ſo <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi>

                  <p>Now with what affection we ſhould call to mind this love, that God would appear to us not by an Angel in a bright cloud, not in a body of pure air, but by his Son in our own fleſh, I leave your own hearts to tell you.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31853:39"/>and ſufferings for us. As the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> do commemorate the truth of his body; ſo do <hi>bread bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> and <hi>wine poured out,</hi> commemorate the truth of his ſufferings for us, which thoſe phantaſtical people in the firſt times did no leſs deny. And the bread and wine being given to us ſeverally, not both together, do clearly tell us that he was really dead, his vital blood being ſeparated from his body, and his veins and heart being emptied of it. This is that miracle of love which the Apoſtle ſaith we ſhould ſhew forth till he come: this is that famous act which never ennobled the ſtory of any perſon, that the Lord would purchaſe enemies by his own blood; yea by the blood of the Croſs reconcile them to himſelf. The thoughts of this is able to wound a heart of marble with love, and to turn a rock into a fountain of tears, and to unlooſe the tongue of the dumb, that they may ſpeak the honour of his Name, and ſhew forth his praiſe. And therefore becauſe this was ſuch a ſingular inſtance of love, and becauſe it contains in it ſo many ſecrets (which we ſhould have before our eyes) it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31853:40"/>the chief thing that we are to make a remembrance of.</p>
                  <p>But, as I ſaid before, there are two parts of this Commemoration, and it cannot be contained within the bounds of this world, but we muſt make it reach as far as Heaven. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We do ſhew it forth and declare it unto men, which is ſufficiently clear by all that hath been ſaid. We do publiſh and annunciate unto all that he is the Saviour of the world, and that he hath died for us, and purchaſed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings thereby beyond the eſtimate and account of humane thought. And further the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that we do extol, praedicate, magnifie, and highly lift up in our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this great benefit, ſo that all may come to the knowledge of it, as far as is in our powers to procure. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration the Miniſter chiefly makes unto the people, and all the people together with him to all that are preſent, ſo that all may wonder at his love.</p>
                  <p>When our Saviour therefore ſaith, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> the meaning is, do this in remembrance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31853:40"/>that I dwelt in fleſh, in memory of what I ſuffered, in memory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite price of my blood which I ſhed for you, in memory of the victory that I have obtained by it over the enemies and tyrants of your ſouls; in memory of the immortal glory that I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for you: celebrate this feaſt in memory of all theſe things, and when I am dead, let me alway live in your heart. Tell them one to another in a ſolemn manner, and declare them in the face of my Church. Let all ages know theſe things as long as the world ſhall laſt; that as the benefit is of infinite merit, ſo may the acknowledgement be an eternal memorial. Be ſo careful in doing this, that when I come again I may find you ſo doing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We do ſhew forth the Lords death unto God, and commemorate before him the great things he hath done for us. We keep it (as it were) in his memory, and plead before him the Sacrifice of his Son, which we ſhew unto him, humbly requiring that grace and pardon, with all other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of it, may be beſtowed on us. And as the Miniſter doth moſt powerfully
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31853:41"/>pray in the virtue of Chriſts ſacrifice when he repreſents it unto God; ſo do the people alſo, when they ſhew unto him what his Son hath ſuffered. Every man may ſay, Behold, O Lord, the bleeding wounds of thy own Son; remember how his body was broken for us, think upon his precious blood which was ſhed in our behalf. Let us die, if he have not made a full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. We deſire not to be pardoned if he have not paid our debt. But canſt thou behold him and not be well pleaſed with us? Canſt thou look on his body and blood which we repreſent to thee, and turn thy face from us? Haſt thou not ſet him forth to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation through faith in his blood? O Lord then ſuffer us ſinful creatures to plead with thee. Let us prevail in the virtue of his ſacrifice for the graces and bleſſings that we need; and hide not thy ſelf from us, unleſs thou canſt hide thy ſelf from thy Son too, whom we bring with us unto thee. In this ſort may we take the boldneſs to ſpeak to God, and together with a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt, we may repreſent our own wants, and we may be confident,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31853:41"/>that when God ſees his Son, when we hold up him (as it were) between his anger and our ſouls, he will take ſome pity, and have mercy upon us. Juſt as a poor man, pleading with a King, commemorates to him the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy deeds of ſome of his Anceſtors, or makes mention of the name of ſome high Favourite, for whoſe ſake he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires his Petition may be granted. So it is with us when we come before God to requeſt mercy of him; we can hope to prevail for nothing, but through the Name of our Lord, whom we can never mention with ſo much advantage, as when we ſolemnly commemorate his ſufferings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings. For then we pray and do ſomething elſe alſo which God hath commanded; ſo that there is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted force of many acceptable things to make us prevalent. And hence I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is, that <hi>Iſid. Peluſ.</hi> calls the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental bread <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It will not be unprofitable to add, That this was one reaſon why the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called this action a Sacrifice (which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now ſo much urge) becauſe it doth repreſent the Sacrifice which Chriſt once offered.

For as our Lord ſaith to his Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> ſo he ſaith to every private Chriſtian the ſame words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. onely there is this difference, that <hi>Do this,</hi> &amp;c. in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> doth manifeſtly referre to thoſe words before, <hi>To take bread, give thanks, and give to others</hi> (which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Miniſters work;) but in St. <hi>Paul, Do this,</hi> &amp;c. referres to, <hi>Take eat,</hi> which immediately precedes, and this is to be done by all.

Beſides</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Sacrament of the Altar</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>was inſtituted by Chriſt for a memorial of that which he offered on the Croſs; now there cannot be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial but of a thing paſt; therefore the Euchariſt could not be a ſacrifice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the oblation of Chriſt on the Croſs, but ſhewed what we were afterward to do.</hi> From hence we argue, That if it was not ſo then, neither is it ſo now. We do nothing but what Chriſt then did; and therefore if he offered no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, neither do we, but onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate that ſacrifice which he was then about to offer. Therefore a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Divine in that Aſſembly made a ſpeech to prove that it could not be demonſtrated out of the Scripture,<note place="margin">Georg. de Atai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</note> that this Sacrament is a ſacrifice, but onely out of the ancient Fathers; and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all the arguments to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo ſtrongly, and the Proteſtants arguments afterwards ſo weakly, that the moſt intelligent were of opinion, that he did not ſatisfie himſelf.

                  <p>I will add but this one thing more, and ſo put an end to this Chapter.

By <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> he underſtands the prayers made for the people when they do partake, (for then the Miniſter, as if he were a kind of Advocate, doth offer them to God, and commit them to his hand) after which follow the <gap reason="foreign">

It will not be out of our way for to obſerve further, that this Pſalm was ſo remarkable, that the next day after theſe Hoſanna's (when he ſaw they wrought nothing upon the Phariſees) he reades them their doom out of it, and declares to them his exaltation though they might kill him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.42. <hi>The ſtone which the builders refuſed, the ſame is become the head of the corner.

                  <p>But yet I would not be ſo miſtaken, as if I thought the Chriſtian thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſiſted only in inward thoughts, and outward words; For there are Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical <hi>actions</hi> alſo whereby we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a moſt delightſome ſacrifice unto God.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not when we come to God, appear before him empty; but we are to conſecrate and offer unto him ſome of our temporal goods for the relief of thoſe that are in want, which may cauſe many thankſgivings to be ſent up by them to God.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.11, 12.</note> It hath
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31853:54"/>been ſaid before, that our whole ſelves ought to be offered as an holocauſt to God, and our love ſhould be ſo great, as to ſpend our ſouls and bodies in his ſervice; now in token that we mean ſo to do, we muſt give ſomething that is ours unto him for to be imployed to his uſes. We are to give God an earneſt of our ſincere and intire devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, by parting with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we call ours, and transferring it to him. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15, 16. where the ſerious Reader (that can ſtay ſo long as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe thoſe Scriptures which I cite) will find both praiſe, and likewiſe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of our goods to others, to be called <hi>ſacrifices.</hi> So that the ſpiritual ſacrifice of our ſelves, and the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſacrifice of our goods to him, may teach the Papiſts that we are <hi>ſacrificers</hi> as well as they, and are made Kings and Prieſts unto God.

And that you may ſee we are engaged to this kind of offering; it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the eating of the Lamb was not all the ſolemnity of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, but they ſacrificed likewiſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of thankſgivings in abundance, that there might be proviſion for the poor.

For the Jews were bound at the three ſolemn feaſts, to be very liberal and bountifull, and offer according to their abilities, that ſo the Levites and ſtrangers, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and Widow might feaſt and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31853:55"/>rejoyce together with them, as you may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt at this feaſt having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to offer beſides the Lamb; he did offer himſelf, which was more then if the cattel upon a thouſand hills had been burnt unto God, or all the world had been laid on its funeral pile. In this he dealt the greateſt charity to the world, and by his poverty made us rich. So that we are the more ingaged, not onely by their example, but by his, to offer up ſomething unto God beſide praiſes, that may ſupply the wants of thoſe who may juſtly look to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by us.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then this Chapter; We muſt remember always when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Table of the Lord, that we are to bring <hi>hearts full of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>mouths full of praiſes,</hi> and <hi>hands full of Almes;</hi> and that we may bring all theſe, we muſt bring our ſelves to be offered to him. Our hearts muſt flame with love, our minds muſt reek with holy thoughts, our mouthes muſt breathe forth praiſes like clouds of incenſe, and our hands muſt not be lifted up with nothing in them; but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31853:56"/>we muſt pay ſuch acknowledgements unto God, that may really teſtifie that we and all ours are his. We are to think that we come ſolemnly to bleſs the Lord for all his mercies, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this great and rich one, that he hath given his Son to die for us, and that he hath purchaſed forgiveneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, grace and ſalvation by his death on ſuch deſireable terms; and we muſt think likewiſe, that bleſſing of him includes in it ſelf ſuch good works as will provoke others for to bleſs him.</p>
                  <p>If you would briefly underſtand therefore what the meaning of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rite is, remember, that it is <hi>a Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of Chriſt</hi> and his death, with hearty thankſgivings for all the benefits we receive thereby.</p>

                  <p>THere will be no ſuch cauſe of joy as the former diſcourſe hath ſpoken of, if we be not faithful unto God and his Son Chriſt. And therefore we muſt further conſider this action,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31853:56"/>
                     <hi>as a Rite whereby we enter iuto Covenant with him.</hi> This is included in our <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> the bread and wine, as well as in our <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> of them; and was expreſſed before, when I ſaid, we muſt offer our ſelves to God as, the greateſt act of our thankſgiving. That offering of our ſelves is ſuch a thing; that it puts us out of our own power; and beſides, we enter here into ſtrict ingagements never to reſume or draw back our ſelves again, never to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any right to have our ſelves in our own diſpoſal. We make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn agreement with the Lord Jeſus, that he ſhall dwell in us, and poſſeſs himſelf of all our faculties, as the ſole Lord and governour of our ſouls. Though this have been done once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready when we were baptized, ſo that we cannot reverſe the deed, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the bond that is between us, yet ſeeing the matter of the Covenant is alway to be performed, and more than one world depends upon it; God thinks fit to take new ſecurity of us, and ſtrengthen our obligations, left we think of letting the debt run on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid one day after another, till we be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31853:57"/>quite bankrupts, and have nothing left whereby to diſcharge it.</p>
                  <p>We are alſo apt to think, that we ſtand indebted unto God in no great ſum; and that though we ſhould ſpend prodigally till the latter part of our life, yet we ſhould have enough to pay him, and give him very good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Therefore it is but neceſſary that we ſhould often be remembred of our huge engagements, preſently to perform our word to him: and when we begin again to fail, and not to keep our credit with him, it is no leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſhould call again upon us, and have us enter into more ſolemn bonds of a ſtricter performance.</p>
                  <p>And truly theſe that know what it is to enjoy God, long for no better entertainment from him when they come to his houſe and table, then that they may be tied faſter to him with new cords of his love, and that it may be made more impoſſible for them to unlooſe themſelves from his ſervice. What is there more in the deſire of a holy ſoul, then to ceaſe to be its own? what greater pleaſure doth it feel, then in parting with it ſelf? To what would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31853:57"/>it be more engaged, then to the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him whom it heartily loves? Let me be bound hand and foot (ſaith ſuch a ſoul) that I may never ſtirre from him. Let me ſeal to him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Deeds to convey my ſelf unto him. If he would have me ſign the Covenant with my Blood, every vein in my body ſhall leap to do him that honour. But rather let him come and ſeat himſelf in my heart, and let him take my deareſt life-blood, if it will do him any ſervice. I accept of a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Saviour: I take him as he is, all broken and bloody. If he will have me follow him with a Croſs upon my ſhoulder, I refuſe no conditions; behold O Lord thy ſervant, do with me as ſeems good in thy ſight.</p>
                  <p>Thus we are to addreſs our ſelves to this Feaſt, as will be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood if we conſider theſe five things:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. If we look upon this <hi>action</hi> onely under the general notion of a holy rite which God hath appointed as an act of his Worſhip; yet the very uſing of it is an acknowledgment of him and his Religion, and an engagement of our ſelves unto him as our God. He that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31853:58"/>was circumciſed, was bound to obſerve the whole Law; and ſo was he that offered ſacrifice to the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at his Altar, engaged to own him that had appointed that Worſhip. Juſt ſo the performing but of one thing which God hath appointed as a ceremony in the Religion of Chriſt, doth tie us to obſerve the whole Religion which he requires, who did appoint that Rite. And you may likewiſe obſerve, That there being a <hi>mutual action</hi> in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, of Gods <hi>giving</hi> ſomething, and our <hi>taking,</hi> it doth expreſs, that we are faſt bound in that Covenant, of which this action is a part. So the giving and taking but of ſo ſmall a thing as a ſtraw, doth bind perſons firmly to that thing whereof they are agreed, and which they conclude in that manner. <hi>Stipulation</hi> (one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt words which we have to ſignifie the confirmation of a Bargain by) was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently made by no ſtronger thing, as the very word doth import, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a ſtraw in its name. And ſo any other thing in the World may be uſed to the ſame purpoſe. The giving and taking of ſix-pence to ſtrike up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31853:58"/>doth lay as faſt hold of a man, as ten thouſand pound in hand. Much more then, this ſolemn giving and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread and Wine, being a piece of Chriſt's Religion, and he ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by them, doth bind us as faſt to him, as if we ſhould repeat every word that he hath ſaid, and profeſs our conſent unto it. We are ſuppoſed to know the tearms of that Writing that Chriſt hath left us, containing our duty and his promiſes; and it is preſumed we are willing to enjoy thoſe promiſes, and ſo to perform thoſe duties; this Action then doth but more ſolemnly conclude the agreement, and we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtand engaged as ſtrongly as if Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants had been drawn between us, and our hand and ſeal were affixed to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But then if we conſider this Action as a coming to Gods Table, and partaking of his meat, we ſhall preſently diſcern that thereby we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs our ſelves of his Family, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to all that we are his Followers and Retainers, and that we own the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the crucified Jeſus. I confeſs that coming to Chriſtian Aſſemblies in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31853:59"/>the firſt times, was an owning of Chriſt, becauſe it was very dangerous; but this Action which was in thoſe Aſſemblies performed, was a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs profeſſion of their belief in him, and friendſhip with him. For the great ſtumbling-block of the Jews was the Croſs of Chriſt; and it was fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Gentiles. To declare therefore this death and Croſs of his, to eat of his dead body, and drink of his blood, was as much as to ſay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in this ſuffering-Saviour, I am a Chriſtian, and will live and dye in this Religion. A ſtranger may come unto a mans houſe, but the friends onely are they that ſit with him at his board; and he that is not true to him of whoſe bread he eats, is the worſt and baſeſt of all Enemies. The Pſalmiſt could put no worſe character upon an enemy then this,<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.9.</note> That he who put forth his hand to eat of his bread, had lifted up his heel againſt him. By coming then to Gods Table, we profeſs our ſelves his familiar friends, in whom he repoſes a truſt; and we can put no greater ſcorn upon him, then by being falſe to him that doth admit us to ſuch
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31853:59"/>a nearneſs. You may obſerve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture theſe two things: Firſt, That eating of bread together, is ſpoken of as a token of friendſhip and agreement, as theſe two places among others will ſatisfie you; <hi>Job</hi> 42.11, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41.1. Bread is never wanting at any Feaſt; and ſo they expreſſed by it a friendly entertainment.

And ſo likewiſe Salt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never abſent from any Meal, and placed upon the Table, it hath been uſed as a ſymbol of friendſhip; and to have eaten Salt with a man, at this day, is proverbially as much as to be well acquainted with him: which was a word as uſual in ancient times among other people;<note place="margin">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31853:60"/>with him. All which I but briefly touch upon, to make it more ſenſible to us, that this participation of Gods bread, is a token that we are of his acquaintance, and we do tell the World hereby, That we profeſs all love and friendſhip to him.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing I would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is, That <hi>Covenants</hi> (in Scripture ſtory) are made by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together: For which I need pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no other places but thoſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.44, 46. where <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Abimelech, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their Compacts with a Feaſt. But you may add (if you pleaſe) that in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.14. where it is ſaid, <hi>the people took of the victuals of the Gibeonites, and asked not counſel at the mouth of the Lord;</hi> i. e. They made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them before they conſulted with the holy Oracle, whether they were what they pretended to be; for ſo ſome good Interpreters both Jewiſh and Chriſtian, expound the words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe elſe we cannot underſtand why it ſhould be a crime to taſt whether their bread was ſo dry as they ſaid (as others think the meaning is) without
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31853:60"/>going to enquire of God the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a fact. It is very likely alſo, that from this original that phraſe is derived, of a <hi>Covenant of Salt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 18.19. 2 Chron. 13.5.</note> which in Scripture-ſtile ſignifies an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and unalterable Settlement; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch Leagues which are made with the profeſſion of the greateſt friendſhip (as if men were cohabitants and familiars) ought to be held moſt ſacred, and religiouſly obſerved. Now this Bread and Wine in the Sacrament is Gods, both as it is offered by us unto him, and as it is conſecrated to repreſent his Son Chriſt unto us; and therefore we by partaking of it, do ſolemnly engage our ſelves unto, and promiſe our fidelity in his ſervice, as thoſe that are his <hi>domeſticks,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire always to remain in his familiarity. But ſuppoſe any perſon ſhould give us his very blood to drink, that we might the more firmly be obliged to him; what could there be deviſed more ſtrong to tie our hearts together? So the conſpirators with <hi>Cataline</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine and joyn themſelves together by drinking of their own blood, that they might be bound in a Covenant exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31853:61"/>the ſtrength of all others which are made by eating of common food. And ſo doth Chriſt take us into his ſociety, and bind us to him, by giving us the repreſentations of his own fleſh and blood to eat and drink, that ſo we might never think of departing from him who hath admitted us to that Food, which is as much beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in its obligatory vertue, as it is in its own proper worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
                  <p>And that you may ſee it more fully verified, that this eating and drinking is a foederal rite between God and us, let it be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. As a Feaſt upon a Sacrifice (in which notion it is moſt rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by an excellent Doctor of our own) from which it will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be intended as a ſolemn profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſts Religion,<note place="margin">D.

                  <p>For the underſtanding of this, you muſt know, That <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being the <hi>Holy City</hi> in <hi>Gods Land,</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31853:61"/>ſaid before) there was a conſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion brought in for the keeping of Gods houſe, and maintaining of his <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> And beſide thoſe of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, there were a great number of occaſional Sacrifices (which were his fleſh) together with their meat and drink-offerings (which were his Bread and Wine) that came in to be his Food, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.11. Theſe common Sacrifices were of three ſorts: The firſt were <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſts</hi> or <hi>Burnt-offerings,</hi> ſo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were conſumed wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Altar by his fire,<note place="margin">Lev. 1.9, 13</note> (which at firſt came from Heaven, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to goe out) none eating of them but himſelf. The ſecond we may call <hi>expiatory,</hi> becauſe they were to make atonement, and reconcile; which were of two ſorts, <hi>Sinne-offerings,</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſs-offerings:</hi> Theſe the Prieſts did eat of (if they were not ſuch whoſe blood was carried within the holy place) as you may read in <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.7, 9. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.9, 10. For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods ſervants, were to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and kept in his Family, and beſide hereby did take the mans guilt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31853:62"/>(as it were) and carry it away:<note place="margin">Lev. 6.25, 26.</note> But none elſe were permitted to eat of it, being ſuppoſed to be in a ſtate of guilt, and not fit to have familiarity with God. The third ſort were <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> which were made to God for ſome <hi>benefits</hi> received (which go among the Hebrews under the name of <hi>Peace</hi>) to teſtifie their gratitude unto him. The fat of theſe offerings being burnt upon the Altar to God, (<hi>Lev.</hi> 3.3, 4.) and one breaſt with a ſhoulder being given to the Prieſt, for his portion, (<hi>Lev.</hi> 7.34.) the remainds were the owners ſhare, that he might eat of Gods meat, and ſo feaſt with him (if he was not in any Legal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs) as you may ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.20.</p>
                  <p>The Examples of ſuch ſacrifices are numerous in the Scripture, not here to be amaſſed together, and wrapt up in theſe ſheets. It may ſuffice to note two places which lie cloſe together: They were ſacrifices of this ſort that <hi>Elkanah</hi> offered when he went yearly unto <hi>Shiloh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.4, 5.</note> giving <hi>portions</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of the ſacrifice) to his whole Family that went with him, but to <hi>Hannah</hi> a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:31853:62"/>
                  <p>Thoſe offerings likewiſe which the ſons of <hi>Eli</hi> made men to abhor, were of the ſame kind, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. and their ſin conſiſted in theſe two enormities: Firſt, That they were not content with that portion which was aſſigned them by Law (<hi>viz.</hi> the breaſt and ſhoulder) but they took what, and as much as they liſt (<hi>ver.</hi> 13.) And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That they took their portion before God had his, <hi>i. e.</hi> before the fat was burnt upon the Altar (<hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16.) a rudeneſs which the Gentiles would not have been guilty of, except ſome belly-gods and Atheiſtical glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons. For when they would ſet forth the intemperance of ſuch a man, they could ſay no worſe then this, <hi>Haut immolata, ſacra devorat;</hi> he devours the ſacrifices before they be offered to God. This I mention, becauſe they were not ſtrangers to this kind of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (no more than to the reſt) but did offer them frequently to their gods. You may take one example out of a multitude, which expreſſes both this cuſtom of eating part of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and likewiſe their forbearance to take any part till God had his. The
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31853:63"/>
                     <hi>Egyptians</hi> (ſaith <hi>Herodotus</hi>) <hi>while the Sacrifices were burning,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Euterpe, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>did beat and knock themſelves; and after they had done ſo, then they made a feaſt of the Reliques of the ſacrifice.</hi> We may learn thus much by the way of theſe Heathens, <hi>That God is to be ſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſelves, and there is no true joy but that which ariſes out of true ſorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that this eating and drinking was intended as a rite of covenanting with that Deity to whom the Sacrifices were offered, or elſe as a profeſſion that they were in the Covenant, and did remain Gods Friends (if they were already of the Religion) you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern from theſe two places, which will lead me to that for which all this is ſaid. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had rehearſed to the people Gods Laws (<hi>Exod. cap.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23.) which he gave on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and then came to ſtrike the Covenant between God and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.5. that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent young men (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſome of the firſt-born who were the Prieſts hitherto) to offer Burnt-offerings and Peace-offerings of Oxen, and half of the Blood he ſprinkled on the Altar, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31853:63"/>God, and the other half he ſprinkled on the people, (<hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8.) as a token of the Covenant between them: But for compleating of the Compact, the chief of the people went up nearer to God, and ſaw that bright appearance, and did eat and drink, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. which ſure muſt be underſtood of their feaſting upon the Peace-offerings which had been ſacrificed unto God, whereby they profeſſed to own that Covenant he had given to them.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, this people made to themſelves other gods, and offered not onely burnt-offerings, but alſo peace-offerings to them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6. and then ſate down <hi>to eat and driuk, and roſe up to play,</hi> i. e. to be wanton, and commit uncleanneſs with each other. Now that this was an aſſociating of themſelves with the Egyptian gods, we may learn from the Apoſtle, who reciting of this paſſage, and ſpeaking of their Idolatry, makes no mention at all of their ſacrificing to theſe new gods, but onely <hi>of this eating,</hi> &amp;c. which did conclude the Ceremony, as if the Idolatry did formally conſiſt in this, and that hereby they did devote
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31853:64"/>themſelves to that ſtrange Worſhip. <hi>Neither be you Idolators,</hi> (ſaith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8.) <hi>as were ſome of them, as it is written, the people ſate down to eat and to drink, and roſe up to play.</hi> By which words you may ſee the Apoſtle makes account, that this eating and drinking of the ſacrifices, was a renouncing of the Covenant of their God, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves to idols. Now becauſe it was the manner (as it ſeems) of ſome of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſtill to feaſt in the Idols Temples, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> famous in that City, which makes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle add thoſe words, ver. 8. <hi>Neither commit fornication, as ſome,</hi> &amp;c. He tells them that this was a plain forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſt, and utterly incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with his Profeſſion. For the vouching of which aſſertion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds them what the Sacrament of the Supper of the Lord doth import, <hi>viz.</hi> a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, participation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. which is as much as to ſay, it is a profeſſion that we as one body, partaking of one bread, do hold communion with Chriſt, and adhere
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:31853:64"/>unto him as our Lord and Head, and that to his Worſhip and Service we do conſecrate our ſelves. For juſt as <hi>Iſrael</hi> by eating of the ſacrifices par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of (or have communion with) the Altar, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>i. e.</hi> profeſs to be of that Religion, and adhere to that way of Worſhip. So it is with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, when they eat of the Body and Blood of the crucified Saviour which was offered for us. And therefore by a likeneſs of Reaſon he concludes, That to partake of the Table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and eat of things ſacrificed to them, was to profeſs to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with thoſe impure ſpirits, and thereby to deſecrate themſelves; it being impoſſible for them at once to be devoted to things ſo quite contrary as Chriſt and the Devil, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>From all which diſcourſe we may thus reaſon, That this holy Sacrament is a Feaſt upon the Sacrifice which Chriſt offered, as the Jewiſh Feaſts were made with the fleſh of thoſe ſacrifices which they offered to God. For the Apoſtle makes the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to eating of the ſacrifices, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31853:65"/>And therefore it is a rite whereby we ſolemnly addict our ſelves to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worſhip of Chriſt, and take upon our ſelves ſtrict engagements to be faithfull in that Covenant that is between us; which is the thing that was to be proved. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> joined themſelves to God by feaſting in his houſe of the Sacrifices; ſo we joyn our ſelves to Chriſt, by feaſting in the place of his Worſhip, and at his Table, upon the remembrances of his body and blood. And our obligations to cleave unto him do as much excel all other tyes in their ſacredneſs, ſtrength and vertue, as the Sacrifice of Chriſt excels the Sacrifice of a Beaſt, or the eating and drinking of his Body and Blood, is beyond all participation of the meat of the ancient Altars. Yea it is ſuppoſed that we are the friends of God before we come hither, and that we are not in any willing unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (elſe we ſhould be ſhut out from partaking of this offering.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our approach to his Table is but more ſtrongly to tye the knot, and to bind us in deeper promiſes, to continue friendſhip with him.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:31853:65"/>
                  <p>If more can be ſaid then this, I may add, that the eating of this ſacrifice is a ſolemn Oath, that we will be true and loyal to him. For even Heathens themſelves did uſe by ſacrifice to bind themſelves in Oaths. From whence it is that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ſignifies that ſacrifice which was ſlain when they made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,<note place="margin">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to cut this ſacrifice (in <hi>Homers</hi> phraſe) is to make a Covenant, which it is likely may be taken from the Hebrew cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, mentioned <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.18. And to ſwear <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, upon the warm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the beaſt, was the greateſt Oath that could be made. When we lay our hands therefore upon the body of Chriſt that was ſacrificed for us, (and much more when we eat of it) we do ſolemnly take our Oaths, that we will be his faithfull foederates, and rather die then ſhrink from thoſe duties to which we bind our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If there be any that look upon eating and drinking of this bread and wine, onely as <hi>ſymbols</hi> of beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt, the matter draws to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31853:66"/>the ſame point; for faith is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace, and comprehends in its ſignification all that God requires. So ſome of the Ancients expound thoſe words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">ver. 54.</note> 
                     <hi>He that eateth my fleſh and, drinketh my blood, hath eternal life,</hi> to ſignifie thus much; He that is made partaker of my wiſdom, through my incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſenſible life among men, ſhall be ſaved.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which the ſoul is nouriſhed and fitted for the ſight of coeleſtial things; and therefore eating and drinking of theſe muſt denote em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of all Chriſt, ſo as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him and to his doctrine. If then we take the body and blood of Chriſt in this Supper repreſented to us, to ſignifie the ſame, and eating and drinking to be onely believing, yet you may eaſily ſee to how much we are engaged if we do really believe.</p>
                  <p>But it is manifeſt to me, that eating
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:31853:66"/>and drinking here, muſt comprehend more then it doth in St. <hi>John:</hi> for elſe we ſhall do nothing at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but what we might do at any other time as well. If it be onely beleeving, and meer ſpiritual eating that here is exerciſed, then we may feed ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this food. And when Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſo frequently, <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> it would be no more ſence then if he had ſaid, <hi>Do this, which yet you may do, without doing this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This eating and drinking therefore muſt be a <hi>profeſsion of our faith;</hi> a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting ſolemnly with God, and a receiving and giving of thoſe pledges of love, which we cannot have any where elſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. And indeed the old Chriſtians did ſo ſacredly bind themſelves hereby to their Saviour, that Heathens were ready to ſuſpect them of dangerous combinations, and ſuch conſpiracies as might prove miſchievous to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. From which imputation whileſt <hi>Pliny</hi> doth acquit them,<note place="margin">L. <hi>10.</hi> Epist. <hi>97.</hi>
                     </note> he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſtructs us for what end they met together at this feaſt. They aſſemble themſelves (ſaith he in a Letter to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31853:67"/>
                     <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor) before day break, and ſing a Hymn to Chriſt as if he were God, and then they do <hi>ſacramento ſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringere;</hi> bind themſelves with a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Oath, not that they will do miſchief to any, but that they will not rob or ſteal, nor commit adultery, nor falſifie their words, nor deny their truſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then after they have eat together, they depart to their own homes. Of more then this they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to him he ſhould never find them guilty; and this was the crime of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in thoſe firſt ages, to engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to commit no crime; which they bound themſelves unto by this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts body and blood.</p>
                  <p>The Greek Chriſtians at this day,<note place="margin">Chriſtop. Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, rit. Eccleſ. Graec.</note> when they take the bread or cup into their hands, make this profeſſion; <hi>Lord I will not give thee a kiſs like</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das; <hi>but I do confeſs unto thee like the poor thief, and beſeech thee to remember me when thy Kingdom comes.</hi> If we do touch the body of Chriſt with trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torous lips, and embrace him with a falſe heart, we ſtain our ſouls with the guilt of that blood which can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſh them from all their other ſins.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31853:67"/>And therefore we muſt come unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to bewail our neglects; and to ſettle our former reſolutions of ſtrict obedience. It is grown even to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb (as <hi>Joſeph.

                  <p>Whenſoever therefore we come to celebrate the memory of Chriſts death in this manner, we muſt remember with our ſelves, that we are aſſembled
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31853:68"/>for to renew our baptiſmal vow and league; and in the devouteſt manner to addict our ſelves to a more conſtant love and ſervice of the Lord Jeſus, We muſt look upon this feaſt to which we are admitted, as a diſclaiming of all enmity to him, and a profeſſion of our continuing a hearty friendſhip, ſo as never to do any hoſtile act againſt him. And thence indeed it is called a <hi>Sacrament</hi> (according to <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others with him) becauſe we here take an Oath to continue Chriſts faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Souldiers, and never to do any thing againſt his Crown and dignity as long as there remains any breath in our bodies. We do repeat our Oath of Allegiance, and ſwear fealty again to him, or (as we ordinarily ſpeak) we <hi>take the Sacrament upon it,</hi> that we will be Chriſts faithfull ſervants and Souldiers, againſt the Devil, World and Fleſh, and never flie from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>Every act of ſin then after ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is not onely treaſon, but perjury; not onely the breaking of our faith, but of our Oath; yea not onely the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſimple Oath, but of Oath
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31853:68"/>upon Oath; which we ought more to dread, then we do to break our bones.</p>
                  <p>We eſteem it an impiety of a high nature, for a Miniſter to give a cup of poyſon into a mans hand inſtead of the blood of Chriſt; and we do deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorre that Prieſt that poyſoned Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.<note place="margin">Venenum ſub ſpecie ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti dedit, vertens calicem vitae in calicem mortis.</note> with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and him that poyſoned <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Emp. turning (as <hi>Nauclerus</hi> his phraſe is) <hi>the cup of life into the cup of death.</hi> But whileſt our hearts ſwell in indignation at ſuch a crime, let us conſider with our ſelves, what a treaſonable act it is, to poyſon our ſouls with our own hands, and by a baſe treachery to God, to ſwallow down curſes and woes into our ſelves. Better were it for us to be choaked with the bread of life, or to feel the venome of Aſps boiling in our veins after the holy cup, then to take an Oath which we take ſmall care to keep; then to go on in a courſe of ſin, after ſuch ſacred profeſſions of our duty and ſervice unto Chriſt. We are amazed to hear that men can touch the Goſpels before a Magiſtrate,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31853:69"/>and kiſs the book, or lift up their hand to Heaven, and yet make good never a word that they ſwear. We are apt to think, that either theſe men have no ſouls, or that they do not value them at the price of a rotten nut. O let our very fleſh then tremble to think, that we ſhould lay our hand upon the body of Chriſt, and take it into our very mouths, and ſolemnly ſwear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and yet not be faithfull in his Covenant, nor heartily indeavour to perform our promiſes unto him. For there is no forſworn perſon hath ſuch a black ſoul, as he whoſe ſoul is foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even by the blood of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which waſhes the ſouls of others. The world cannot but ſhrink at the thoughts of that fearful act of one of the Popes, who making a League with <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the French King, divided the bread of the Sacrament into three parts, with this ſaying (ſcarce tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) <hi>As the holy Trinity is but one God, ſo let the union indure between us three confederates;</hi> and yet he was the firſt that broke it and ſtarted from the agreement. Far be it from us then after this action wherein we joyn our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31853:69"/>ſelves to God, and unite our hearts to fear his Name, and become as it were one with him, to reſcind our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, or ſtand again at tearms of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance. But let us have a care to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Vow far more religiouſly then we do an Oath to any mortal man, which yet no perſon of credit and conſcience would break for all the world.</p>

                  <p>TO all thoſe that are thus faithfully in Covenant with him, this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a further ſign and ſeal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin.</p>
                  <p>For the Law of Covenants doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that where one party doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs friendſhip, and ingage to fidelity; the other perſon in the agreement ſhould make aſſurance of his love, and confirm his promiſes. And therefore when we come with hearts full of love to renew our friendſhip with God, we may beleeve that he doth embrace us alſo with the deareſt affection, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31853:70"/>us greater teſtimonies that he hath cancelled all the bonds wherein we ſtood indebted to him: <hi>Bonds</hi> able to break the whole world, if payment were exacted; <hi>Debts</hi> which all men and Angels cannot poſſibly diſcharge; which yet he is ſo willing to acquit us of, that he hath appointed this <hi>holy action</hi> for that end, that we may have more pledges of his love, and more aſſurance that we are not bound over to eternal puniſhment. Well may we run into the armes of Chriſt where we expect to receive ſuch favours. It is no wonder if we be forward to tye our ſelves faſt to God (as I ſaid in the laſt Chapter) when he binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as faſt to us. We need not ſtand ſo much upon it to promiſe even to die for him, when it is but the way to life. We may be glad to lie in the wounds of Chriſt, when we find a cure there for our ſins. A crucified Saviour ſhould be moſt dear unto us, and we ſhould moſt joyfully kiſs his croſs, ſeeing we hope thereby to have our iniquities croſſed out, and ſtand no longer upon our account.</p>
                  <p>Methinks all that hear of ſuch a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31853:70"/>Covenant of Grace ſhould be deſirous to enter into it (and ſo they would if they had not as trifling conceits of the evil of ſin, as they have of the worth of their ſouls:) And all that are in that Covenant ſhould be glad of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to reiterate it, that they may have ſtronger grounds whereon to hope for pardon. And it is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to the ſingular mercy of God, that we can never come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs any love to him, but he will return back a great deal more to us; and that when we give thanks to him, he will give us more cauſe to thank him.</p>

                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:31853:71"/>or the <hi>Blood</hi> cannot be a Teſtament or Covenant, but the giving and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the cup or blood is; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>This is the new Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> muſt be meant, this action is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between you and me, made in the blood of the Lamb for the forgiveneſs of your ſins.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Doing of this</hi> doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe a Covenant of Grace which God hath made, and which we own in Chriſts blood; but beſides, it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a profeſſion (both on Gods part, and on ours who do receive) of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and making good that which we are reſpectively bound unto: ſo that God doth there tender all that which he <hi>promiſeth</hi> in the Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we by receiving do bind our ſelves (as you have ſeen) to all the Goſpel, and mands. Now this is the great thing that God promiſeth in his Covenant, <hi>I will be mercifull to their unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and their ſins, and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Action</hi> therefore is appointed by him, not onely to be a <hi>ſymbol</hi> of his ſufferings which did ratifie the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of forgiveneſs, but to be an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:31853:71"/>of himſelf, for to put us in poſſeſſion of the great thing purchaſed by his blood, which was pardon to all penitent ſinners.</p>
                  <p>The blood of the Paſchal Lamb (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves) was ſhed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">In Matth. 26.</note> for the ſaving of the firſt-born of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but Chriſts blood (who is our Paſſeover) was ſhed for the remiſſion of the ſin <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, of the whole world. Now though the ſhedding of the blood, and ſprinkling of it on the door poſts, were the cauſe of the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; yet their eating of the Lamb was that which did entitle them to it, and gave them a right to that ſalvation. So though the blood of Jeſus ſhed upon the tree be that which procures the pardon, and be the price of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; yet that remiſſion is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly exhibited and given unto us, or (as we ſpeak) applied to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by the eating of this bread, and drinking of this cup, which are as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual as Deed or Inſtrument for the conveying of this mercy unto us. We may ſee this well explained to our hands by an ancient Author. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31853:72"/>(ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) is a ſacred ſign or ſecret,<note place="margin">Serm. de Coena.</note> as may be illuſtrated by a common example. If I give a Ring to a friend, it hath no other ſignificancy, but that I love him: but if I give him a Ring, <hi>ad inveſtiendum de haereditate aliqua,</hi> thereby to inveſt him in the right of ſome inheritance, then it is both a Ring and a ſign alſo. In like manner, though Bread and Wine ſet before us, do denote nothing more then the kindneſs of a friend that would refreſh us; yet given and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a religious rite, and in token of a Covenant, they are turned into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, and are both Bread and Wine, and likewiſe the inſtrument of a conveyance. And this is the change which the Ancients mention of the Bread and Wine into the body and blood of Chriſt: a change, not in the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but in the <hi>accidents;</hi> not in their <hi>nature,</hi> but in their <hi>uſe;</hi> not in any <hi>natural quality,</hi> but in their <hi>ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, application</hi> and <hi>divine efficacy.</hi> As when the wax is imprinted and made a ſeal, or ſilver ſtamped and made a coin, they remain the ſame in ſubſtance, and yet are changed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31853:72"/>of their uſe and value alſo. So it is with the bread and wine when they are offered unto God, and delivered by him again to us, and received as a repreſentation of the Lord Jeſus: they continue what they were, if we look onely at their matter; but are changed by Gods appointment into divine things, if we reſpect the end to which they are applied, which is to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us the bleſſing of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> remiſſion of ſins.</p>

Now as by this later ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, he can intend no more but our myſtical incorporation with him, ſo by the former nothing elſe is to be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:31853:73"/>underſtood, but the converſion of the bread to no other uſe, ſo that in effect it is made the body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort; he that hath the picture of a King in his Chamber, hath but a bare ſign which may make him think of him, and no more: but he that hath the Kings great Seal, which confirms him in the poſſeſſion of all the land he injoyes, hath his picture and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that comes along with it, which inſtates him in a real good. And though the wax affixed to the writing be the ſame for ſubſtance with that which is in a mans ſhop, yet for vertue (as it is made uſe of) it is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and far better then all the wax that a whole County can afford. Even ſo it is in this caſe before us; Bread bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and Wine poured out, are but bare ſigns of Chriſts ſufferings, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them nakedly in themſelves: but if we look on them as a foederal rite, and as they are given to us, and eaten and drunken by us in remembrance of the death of Chriſt, ſo they are ſeals and further confirmations of Gods great love towards us. And though they are ſtill the ſame for ſubſtance,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31853:73"/>with the moſt common Bread and Wine which we uſe at our Meals; yet in regard of the uſe to which now they are converted, they become Sacred and of great vertue to convey unto us the things expreſſed in the Covenant, which are of more worth then all the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is further manifeſt that we are hereby confirmed in the ſtate of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiveneſs, becauſe we do here put forth the moſt ſolemn act of <hi>Charity</hi> and Forgiveneſs to all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For it is a Feaſt of Love (as you ſhall ſee afterwards) and this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition upon which our forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depends, that we forgive others;<note place="margin">Matt. 6.14, 15.</note> and therefore when we here pray for all men, and put away all enmity out of our hearts, never to return any more, God is engaged to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us as a friend, and to let fall all differences that have been between him and us. I know that we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to harbour any hatred in our hearts, and that we cannot pray ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully at any time, unleſs we lift up pure hands without wrath; and I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wiſh the Doctrines of Love were
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31853:74"/>moſt frequently and ſeverely preſſed and practiſed; but yet there is no time when we do more narrowly ſearch our ſelves to find out the reliques of that ſowre leaven, and when we are more powerfully moved to extinguiſh even the leaſt ſpark or ſeeds of fire that are in our ſouls, then when we conſider Chriſts death, and remember how he prayed for his Enemies upon the Croſs. And therefore I conceive, that upon this account, the Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Blood, may be a means of aſſuring our pardon, and ſtrengthning of our title to Forgiveneſs. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I conſider with my ſelf, that this duty of pardoning others, is not ſo peculiar to this Sacrament, but that it may, and muſt be done (as I ſaid) at all other times; and for that cauſe I ſhall paſs it by, and proceed to that which I would have moſt of all obſerved, for the underſtanding of this part of my Diſcourſe, and that is this:</p>
                  <p n="3">III. This eating and drinking is <hi>a feaſt upon a ſin-offering,</hi> and therefore is a greater pledg of remiſſion of ſin. That you may conceive of this aright,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31853:74"/>it muſt be remembred, That though the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> uſed to feaſt upon their peace-offerings which were made at the Altar (as hath been ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) yet they were not admitted to eat of any elſe. The whole <hi>Burnt-offerings</hi> indeed had <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending alway upon them; and ſo they did partake of the Altar, when they were offered, by eating of the latter; but of the former none taſted but God himſelf. The <hi>Offerings for ſinne</hi> (as you have ſeen) were the portion of the Prieſts, and the people were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from them, unleſs you will ſay that they eat by them as their ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and mediators: But now you muſt further note, That though the Prieſts were to eat of the <hi>ſin-offering</hi> for particular perſons; yet of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice made for the ſinne of the whole Congregation, whoſe blood was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the holy place; the Prieſts themſelves might not eat (and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently nor the people by them) but they were to burn its fleſh without the Camp. And whether it were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the day of general atonement, (<hi>Lev.</hi> 16.27.) or at any other time when
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31853:75"/>the whole Congregation had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſin through ignorance (<hi>Lev.</hi> 4.13.21. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.30.) that an offering was to be made for them; they were not permitted to have the leaſt ſhare of it. Now Chriſt made his ſoul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſinne,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10.</note> and ſuch an offering, that with his blood he entred into the holy place, and ſuffered without the Camp, and therefore was moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſet forth by that ſacrifice, which was for the whole Congregation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording then to the Law, none was to feed upon the Sacrifice; and yet our Lord hath indulged unto us the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of feaſting upon this great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Propitiation; according as the very words of the Inſtitution of this Sacrament do intimate, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith,<note place="margin">Mark 14.24.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many,</hi> i. e. which is like to the Sacrifice on the great Day of Atonement, which was not made for one perſon, but for the whole Congregation; and of this I give you leave to drink. This was a favour never granted to the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and beſides what the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, it is remarkable what
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31853:75"/>is delivered by <hi>Porphyry,</hi> as the ſence of all the Heathen Divines in the World,<note place="margin">

This things ſure muſt contain in it ſome great myſtery: for the Apoſtle ſeems to take notice of it, when he ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. <hi>We have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat which ſerve the Tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Altar</hi> in this place is by a Metonymie put for a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the ſence of the Apoſtles diſcourſe in that and the following verſes is this: Go out of the Synagogue, and never
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31853:76"/>meddle with the Jewiſh Religion; though you may endure perſecution by them, as Chriſt did; for you enjoy this ſpecial priviledg, of eating of the ſacrifice of Chriſt which was made for ſinne without the Gate, and whoſe Blood was carried into the holy place, a thing which no Jew could ever have any right unto, in thoſe ſinne-offerings that were made among them. The true intent of this grant which Chriſt hath made us, contrary to the manner of all the World, may be to ſhew our union with his Sacrifice, and that the righteouſneſs of it is as truly imputed to us, as if we could have made ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction our ſelves. And (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39.) it ſhews that we are juſtified by him from all thoſe things which we could not be juſtified from by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This difference therefore is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able between the legal Sacrifices and this repreſentation of Chriſts ſacrifice: In them was made <gap reason="foreign">

They might not, becauſe ſinne was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged thereby to remain; we may, becauſe by Chriſts offering to make expiation, it is aboliſhed, and utterly deſtroyed, ſo as to have no force to oblige us unto puniſhment.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31853:77"/>clear, that onely by the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant forgiveneſs could be obtained, for the greateſt of their Sacrifices (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle) made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſins, and not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of them.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this then, you may thus take a very brief ſum of it. Before the flood they onely offered <hi>Holocauſts or whole burnt offerings,</hi> (for then they eat no fleſh:) After the flood they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> alſo for mercies which they received; and theſe they all eat of. But we read of no <hi>ſin-offering</hi> till the Law was given; and thoſe the Prieſts onely eat of, but not of all. Till the Goſpel came, never did any eat of a ſin-offering that was carried within the vail to reconcile withall; but now both Prieſt and People partake of it.<note place="margin">Rev. 1.6.</note> We are all made <hi>Priests unto God</hi> in this regard, that as the Prieſts of old had the favour to eat of the body and ſo have all the people of God now, by communicating of Sin-offerings, blood of Chriſt, who offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto God for us. And it muſt be added,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> that we are <hi>more then Prieſts, even Kings and Prieſts, or a Royal
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31853:77"/>Prieſthood,</hi> for there is nothing denied unto us, and we have power to eat of that which the High-Prieſt himſelf might not taſt of, which is the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of general Atonement, whoſe fleſh was burnt without the Camp. And if we well conſider, we ſhall ſee that they had no reaſon to feaſt upon it, ſeeing the guilt did ſtill remain which their ſacrifice could not remove; but that we have, becauſe our offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſinne hath made a compleat expiation, and given us the greateſt ground of joy and peace. Now by our eating of it, we muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to partake even of that Altar, and ſo to have remiſſion of ſin.</p>
                  <p>To draw then the Chapter to a Concluſion; If we take a review of what hath been ſaid in this and the foregoing Diſcourſe, we may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently informed what Divines mean when they ſay, That the Sacrament is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace. We ſet our Seal to it, as we give up our ſelves to God; and God ſets his Seal again to it, by delivering the body and blood of his Son to us. The death of Chriſt there repreſented, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31853:78"/>to us, doth ſeal to us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſinne, and all bleſſings; if we do heartily ſet our ſeal to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart, and by taking and receiving Chriſt under theſe ſigns, promiſe and engage moſt firmly to lead a life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will revealed to us. God ſeals when he gives; and we ſeal when we receive. If we mean as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as he doth, then we have a right to all things ſpecified in the Covenant. By which you may diſcern, that it is not a ſeal that we are pardoned, and our ſinnes are forgiven; but that God remains firm in his purpoſes of Grace, and if we do ſo too in our purpoſes of obedience, we may thence conclude that we are pardoned. Our aſſurance then of our particular pardon, is a thing that reſults from another act of ours, which is a ſerious comparing of our ſeal and Gods together, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon what we and God have done. When we know our own ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and heartineſs in our profeſſion, as we are aſſured of Gods reality and truth in what he promiſeth, then we may conclude well of our ſelves, and reſt aſſured of a pardon.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:31853:78"/>
                  <p>Yet our pardon is not ſealed ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as God ſeals the Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the certainty <hi>that we have in our ſelves</hi> of our being pardoned, relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thing far more dubious then the certainty we have that God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Our judgment concerning our ſelves, is <hi>onely an humane act</hi> grounded upon the true knowledg of our ſelves, whereas our beliefe of the promiſe, is <hi>a divine faith,</hi> grounded upon the word of God to which he ſets his ſeal; and therefore the concluſion we make (which ſtill follows the weaker part) or the aſſurance we attain of our being pardoned, can be onely an act of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane faith: It can never be ſo ſure as one of the premiſſes is, unleſs we could be as ſure that we ſay true of our ſelves, as that God ſaith true of himſelf. If it were as certain that <hi>I beleeve,</hi> as it is that <hi>God will pardon all that beleeve,</hi> then the Concluſion would be as certain as either, that <hi>therefore I am pardoned.</hi> But ſeeing the firſt Propoſition is grounded on a fallible judgment (and it is poſſible I may deceive my ſelf) therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a concluſion of equal cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31853:79"/>with the ſecond propoſition, but, <hi>That I am pardoned,</hi> will be no ſtronger then this, <hi>That I beleeve.</hi> Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if a man find no cauſe to ſuſpect his own reality, he may have a belief of his pardon free from doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and may reſt well ſatisfied that he is in a good eſtate, becauſe nothing appears to the contrary, but that he ſincerely doth the Will of Chriſt. Though he attains unto this perſwaſion not by a direct, but a reflex act of faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> not meerly by a belief of Gods Word, (which no where ſaith that I am pardoned) but by a ſerious examination of himſelf according to the tenor of the Word; yet ſeeing he diſcerns a conformity between himſelf and it, he may have a very good and ſtrong (though not infallible) aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that his ſinnes are blotted out, and ſhall not be imputed to him.</p>
                  <p>Whenſoever then we approach to the Lords Table, we ſhould come with a belief, that God makes over unto us the greateſt bleſſings, if we receive them as he requires. Now all that he requires is, That we would love and obey him (as we ſaid in the former
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:31853:79"/>Chapter;) when we heartily engage to this, we have hereby a conveyance made to us of all that Heaven contains, which is included in this phraſe, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſinne.</hi> For you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that in Scripture-ſtile, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of Gods Wrath is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome favour. His kindneſſes are not meer <hi>negatives</hi> or removals of evil; but when he forgives ſinne, and inflicts not the puniſhment, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres the contrary bleſſing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores us to the inheritance.</p>

                  <p>THE diſtance being taken away between God and us, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be conſidered as a means of our <hi>nearer union</hi> with our Lord Chriſt. He doth not onely embrace us when we come to his Table, but he likewiſe knits and joins us to himſelf. He not onely ties us with Cords of Love, and binds us to his ſervice by favours and bleſſings conferred on us; but in ſome ſort he makes us one with him,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31853:80"/>and takes us into a nearer conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then before we enjoyed. And who would not deſire to be infolded in his arms? Who would not repoſe himſelf in his boſome? but who durſt have preſumed to entertain a thought of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married unto him, and becoming one with him? And yet who would refuſe ſuch a favour now that it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to us, but they that neither know him, nor themſelves?</p>
                  <p>This Covenant into which we enter, is a <hi>Marriage-Covenant,</hi> and our Lord promiſes to be as a <hi>Husband</hi> to us, and we chuſe him as the beſt beloved of our ſouls. It is none of the common friendſhips which we contract with him by eating and drinking at his Table, but the rareſt and higheſt that can be imagined; and we are to look upon this as a <hi>Marriage-Feaſt.</hi> What this union then with Chriſt is, it need not be diſputed; we may be ſure that it is ſuch an one as is between a man and his wiſe, the Vine and the Branches, the Head and the Members, the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Foundation, as hereafter will more fully appear) yea far beyond all ſorts of union, whether moral, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31853:80"/>or artificial, which the world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords example of. That which I am to ſhew, is, That by theſe Sacramental Pledges of his Love, and this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt our Lord, we are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter tied unto him, and the Ligaments are made more ſtrong and indiſſoluble between us. This will be manifeſt upon theſe conſiderations:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Seeing we do after a ſort eat Chriſts fleſh, and drink his Blood, we muſt needs thereby be incorporated further with him. I diſpute not now in what ſence we eat and drink his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood; but ſo far as we grant that we do that, ſo far the other is likewiſe done. Our union is of the ſame kind and degree with our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and participation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a communion with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. that adhaeſion and cleaving to Chriſt, ſignifies, That in ſome ſort we are made one with him. So <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves, That the Apoſtle uſeth not the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is <hi>participation,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Communion,</hi> becauſe he would ſhew the near conjunction that is between us, and that we are knit
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31853:81"/>and united to him by this partaking of him. So likewiſe <hi>Oecumenius</hi> upon the place obſerves, That Chriſts blood uniteth us to him as our Head, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by our receiving of it. And indeed as it is contrary to all analogy of ſpeech, to call the Bread and Wine by the Name of Chriſts Body and Blood, if they be not at all ſo; in like manner it is incongruous to uſe the phraſe of eating and drinking, if there be no union between us and that which we eat and drink.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Faith and Love bearing a great part in this holy action, and Chriſt being by them embraced, it muſt needs be a means of our nearer union. For union (you know) begins in our conſent unto him; and therefore the ſtronger that grows, and with the greater dearneſs of affection that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; the ſtronger and cloſer our union to him becomes. Now Faith and Love (which are our conſent) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive here a great encreaſe of ſtrength, by the moſt intenſe operation of them, which is apt to perfect and compleat them. No man comes aright hither, that doth not from the bottom of his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31853:81"/>heart (as you have ſeen) put himſelf into the will of Chriſt to be moved and governed at his pleaſure. He muſt run into Chriſts heart, to have no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but according as that beats, ſo that his whole life ſhould be put to a pulſe anſwering to the heart of Chriſt. And ſo <hi>Cyril</hi> brings in Chriſt calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, and ſaying, I am the bread of life; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Hom. in myſt. Caen.</note> take me in as a leaven to diffuſe it ſelf through your whole maſs. Be you even leavened with me, that every bit of you may taſte of me. This can be effected by nothing elſe but a hearty conjunction of our wills with Chriſts. We muſt put our ſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of our own power, as the wife doth, when ſhe gives her ſelf to her husband; and the more we can get out of our ſelves, ſo as to have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will of our own, the more we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with him. When we feel not our ſelves to be any thing at all, nor to have any intereſt different from that of his, then we and he are made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly one, or rather we are not, but he is <hi>All.</hi> Now this abolition of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and ſelf, is much promoted by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31853:82"/>the remembrance of Chriſts death and his unvaluable love, whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead, and are even ſnatched and raviſhed from our ſelves. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other unions there may be, they all wait and attend upon this which lays the foundation of them. Yea by this faith and love our hearts are more inlarged, the veſſels of our ſouls are rendred more capable, and the Temple of Chriſt is much more amplified to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more of Gods preſence. And that is the next thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The holy Spirit is here confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on us in larger meaſures, which is the very bond and ligament that ties us to him. For this union is not onely ſuch a moral union as is between huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife (which is made by love) or between King and Subjects (which is made by Laws) but ſuch a natural union as is between head and members, the vine and branches, which is made by one ſpirit or life dwelling in the whole.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding of this (which I ſhall inſiſt on longer then thereſt) you muſt conſider theſe things;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our union with Chriſt is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:31853:82"/>ſet forth by many things in Scripture, or in St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, He unites us to himſelf after many patterns. I think there is not a better collection of them, then we meet with in him. He is the head (faith he) we are the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>8.</hi> in <hi>1.</hi> ad <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     </note> He is the foundation, we are the building; He is the vine, we are the branches; He is the bridegroom, we are the bride; He is the ſheepherd, we are the ſheep; He is the way, we are the travellers; We are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and he is the inhabitant; He is the firſt-born, we his brethren; He is the Heir, we the coheirs: He is the life, we are the living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe thing <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, do ſhew an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch an one that will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt thing to come between them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve, that the higheſt and cloſeſt union is that which is made by one ſpirit and life moving in the whole. And therefore I take notice that the Scripture delights moſt frequently to uſe the two firſt examples of a body, and a building, and thoſe that are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to theſe. Now becauſe a building
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:31853:83"/>hath no life, but yet by its firmneſs and ſtrength doth notably ſet forth the firmneſs of the union that is between Chriſt and his people; therefore the Apoſtle puts both theſe together, and calls Chriſt a <hi>living ſtone,</hi> and thoſe that come to him, <hi>lively or living ſtones,</hi> which are built up a ſpiritual houſe or temple, where they offer ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſacrifices unto God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5. That union therefore is moſt perfect which is made by life, though others may be of great eſt ſtrength, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle applies it even to things without life, that he might the better ſhew, that the union between Chriſt and his members by one life, is in ſtrength more like the ſolidneſs of a Temple then any other thing, whoſe parts are ſo cemented as that they would laſt as long as the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt obſerve, That things at the greateſt diſtance may be united by one ſpirit of life actuating them both, and ſo may Chriſt and we, though we enjoy not his bodily preſence. It is truly noted by a moſt Rev.<note place="margin">A. uſher.</note> Perſon, that the formal reaſon of the union that is made between the parts of our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31853:83"/>body, conſiſts not in their continuity and touching of each other, but in the animation of them by one and the ſame ſpirit which ties them all together. If the ſpirit withdraw it ſelf from any part ſo that it be mortified, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently remains as if it were not of the body, though its parts ſtill touch the next member to it. And ſo we ſee in trees, if any branch be deprived of the vegetative ſpirit, it drops from the tree as now no more belonging to it. On the other ſide, you ſee the toes have an union with the head (though at a diſtance) not onely by the intervening of many parts that reach from them unto it, but by the ſoul that is preſent in the fartheſt member, and gives the head as ſpeedy notice of what is done in the remoteſt part, as if it were the next door to the brain. And this it doth without the aſſiſtance of the neighbouring parts that ſhould whiſper the grief of the toes from one to the other till the head hear, but without the leaſt trouble to any of them, which do not feel their pain. If you ſhould ſuppoſe therefore our body to be as high as the Heavens,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31853:84"/>and the head of it to touch the throne of God, and the feet to ſtand upon his footſtool the earth, no ſooner could the head think of moving a toe, but preſently it would ſtir; and no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could any pain befall the moſt diſtant part, then the head would be adviſed of it. Which muſt be by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that ſpirit which is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alike preſent to every part, and therefore that muſt be taken likewiſe to be the reaſon of that union which is among them all. Juſt ſo may you apprehend the union to be between Chriſt our head, and us his members; Although in regard of his corporal preſence he be in the Heavens, which muſt receive him untill the time of the reſtitution of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. yet he is here with us always, even to the end of the world (<hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.) in regard of his holy Spirit working in us. By this he is ſenſible of all our needs, and by the vital influences of it in every part, he joyns the whole body fitly together, ſo that he and it make one Chriſt, according as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31853:84"/>members of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> one body, being many, are one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt.</hi> And that this union is wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (which every true Chriſtian hath dwelling in him, <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.) the next verſe (<hi>ver.</hi> 13.) will tell you, <hi>we are all baptized into one body by one ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. Which will lead me to the fourth thing for which all this was ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We receive of this Spirit when we worthily communicate at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, according as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in that 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe is thought to ſay, <hi>We have been all made to drink into one ſpirit,</hi> i. e. we have all reaſon to agree well together, for there is but one ſpirit that animates the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of us, which we receive at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord when we drink the cup of bleſſing. One Chriſtian doth not drink out of the ſame cup a ſpirit of peace, and another Chriſtian a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of contention; but as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expounds it, <gap reason="foreign">

For in both we are watered with one and the ſame ſpirit, even as trees (ſaith he) are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered out of one and the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.<note place="margin">

                     </gap> is uſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8.) that which he hath planted; yet ſtill it will be true, that at this time good Chriſtians do receive larger irrigations from that fountain of life, that they may ſhoot up to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er height, and bring forth more fruit. For this ſpirit is always needfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which maintains our life, and it is given in the uſe of thoſe means that God hath inſtiruted for increaſe in grace, of which means this holy feaſt being one of the chief, that life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſpirit muſt be conceived to lay faſter hold of us, and knit us more unto our head. It is the <hi>vis vicaria</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, that power which ſupplies his place here in the world, by which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31853:85"/>he is preſent to our ſouls. Now when ſhall we conceive it more preſent, then when we remember him whoſe ſpirit it is, and when he doth exhibit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us under theſe ſhadows of bread and wine? Theſe are tokens of his preſence, and repreſent him to us; the ſpirit is that whereby he is preſent, and therefore here it muſt be again conferred on us. Here it doth take a ſtronger ſeizure of us; here it poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf more fully of all our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; here it gives us more ſenſible touches from our head, and makes us feel more vital influences deſcending thence unto us; and ſo (it being the bond of union) muſt needs ſtrengthen and confirm us in an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him. Chriſt doth not deſcend <hi>locally</hi> unto us that we may feed on him; but as the Sun toucheth us by his beams without removing out of its ſphaere, ſo Chriſt comes down upon us by the power of the holy Ghoſt, moving by its heavenly vertue in our hearts, though he remain above. And this vertue coming from our Head the man Chriſt Jeſus, it doth both quicken us to his ſervice, and tie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31853:86"/>us to him, and likewiſe we are ſaid to partake of his body and blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſenſibly feel the vertue and efficacy of them in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And do not wonder that I ſay we are more ſtrongly united to Chriſt hereby; for unſon is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceved without all latitude, but to be looked on as capable of increaſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, and as that which may grow looſe and ſlack, or be made more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compact. As it is with the foul and body, ſo it is between Chriſt and his members. Though the ſoul be not quite unlooſed from the body, yet by ſickneſs the bonds may become rotten, or by faſting they may grow weak and feeble, ſo that it may have but a ſlender hold of its companion, and a little violence may ſnap them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder. Even ſo though our ſouls be tied to Chriſt, yet by our daily infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or the frequent incurſions of our enemies, or by long abſtaining from this holy food, and other negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, we ſhall find a kind of looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our ſouls, and that we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off from Chriſt, and tending to a diſſolution, unleſs we gird up the loyns
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31853:86"/>of our mind, and be vigilant and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, watching unto all holy duties. And therefore as in the former caſe we muſt betake our ſelves to our phyſick, and food, and good exerciſe for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the bonds ſound and ſtrong; ſo in this we muſt have recourſe to the holy feaſt we are ſpeaking of (which is both meat and medicine) and we muſt ſtir up the grace that is in us, and beg more of the Spirit of God that may ſtrengthen the things that remain and are ready to die.</p>
                  <p>To receive the Spirit not by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is the priviledg of none but our head. We that receive from his full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have not our portion all at once,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.19.</note> but muſt daily look for a <hi>ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note> 
                     <hi>The righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith; and we muſt grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Chriſt.</hi> Which ſhews that we may be made one with him in a more excellent manner then when we were firſt born, becauſe the Spirit of Chriſt grows unto a greater ſtrength within us, as we receive more of heavenly nutriment into our ſouls.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:31853:87"/>
                  <p>And this is all that is meant by the <hi>real preſence</hi> of Chriſt in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Church ſpeaks of and believes; as it is one reaſon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the <hi>change</hi> which is ſo much noiſed, becauſe by his power theſe things become effectual to ſo great purpoſes, when they are holily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Our Lord doth call theſe ſigns by the name of the things they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, becauſe in a ſpiritual manner his body and blood are preſent to us, <hi>viz.</hi> by the communication of that to us which they did purchaſe for us. From the ſacred humanity of Chriſt, life and ſpirit is derived unto us, as motion is from the head unto the members. And the power of the Godhead doth diffuſe the vertue or operation of the humane nature, to the enlivening the hearts of men that rightly receive the Sacramental pledges. <hi>Manna</hi> is called ſpiritual bread, and water that came out of the rock is named ſpiritual dirnk,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.3, 4.</note> and the rock is ſaid to be Chriſt, becauſe they did ſignifie him, and were tokens of his preſence; and therefore much more may this bread and wine be called his body and blood,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31853:87"/>and ſpoken of as if they were himſelf, becauſe they do more lively repreſent him, and he had annexed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence more powerfully to them. Or as one of the Ancients ſaith, they are called his body and blood, not becauſe they are properly ſo, <hi>ſed quod in ſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterium corporis ejus &amp; ſanguinis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineant,</hi> but becauſe they contain in them the myſtery of his body and blood.</p>
                  <p>And this (as I ſaid) is all the change that we are to underſtand in them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth excellently expreſs it:<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Dialog. 1.</note> Chriſt (ſaith he) calls them by the name of the things they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>not changing the nature, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding grace unto the nature.</hi> And what that grace is I have already told you in this Chapter. So that the <hi>real preſence</hi> is not to be ſought in the bread and wine, but in thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, according as Learned <hi>Hooker</hi> ſpeaks. For Chriſt ſaith firſt, <hi>Take and eat;</hi> and then after that, <hi>This is my body.</hi> Before we take and eat, it is not the body of Chriſt unto us; but when we take and eat as we ought, then he gives us his whole ſelf, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31853:88"/>puts us into poſſeſſion of all ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving graces as his facrificed body can yield, and our fouls do then need. The change is in our ſouls, and not in the Sacrament; we are though not <hi>Tranſubſtantiated</hi> into another body, yet <hi>Metamorphoſed</hi> and transformed into another likeneſs, by the offering up of our bodies to God, which is a piece of this ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2. And ſo ſome obſerve that all other meat is received as it is in it ſelf, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but this meat is divers, as it is received. Other meat affecteth and altereth the taſte, but here the taſte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the meat. For if it be worthily received, it is the body and blood of Chriſt; if unworthily, it is but bare bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>But yet this muſt be cautiouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood when we thus ſpeak; for his preſence <hi>is with the bread,</hi> though not <hi>in it.</hi> Though it be onely <hi>in us,</hi> yet it comes <hi>with it</hi> unto us if we will receive him; becauſe elſe we ſhall not know how unworthy perſons are ſaid to be <hi>guilty of his body and blood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.27.</note> if he be not preſent with his body and blood to work in mens ſouls.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:31853:88"/>
                  <p>This likewiſe is to be further obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the better under ſtanding of it; that the Devil who loves to imitate God, (that he may the better cozen and cheat) doth ſeldom manifeſt his power to any great purpoſe, but when he is called by ſome of his own ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſacraments that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. This doth but tell us that Chriſt is then moſt powerfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when we uſe his rites which he hath inſtituted and hallowed as ſpecial remembrances of his love, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of our love unto him. So that we may come hither, and expect that we ſhall feel more at ſuch a time, and in the uſe of ſuch means, then at or in others, becauſe he hath made them his body and blood in ſuch ſort as I have declared.</p>
                  <p>Other union then this (by Chriſts ſpirit) I know no uſe of, though we ſhould believe that which we do not underſtand. I can conceive great things concerning the power of Chriſts humane nature; and it is not for us to tell how far it may extend its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences through the inhabitation of the Deity. That it is brighter then the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31853:89"/>Sun, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw when the Lord appeared to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.13. And as the Sun we ſee, communicates his beams a vaſt way, and twiſts it ſelf about us by ſilver threads of light, though ſeated in the Heavens; ſo may we conceive that the ſacred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt doth tie us to it ſelf by cords of love, and now embrace us in its outſtretched armes after a more affectionate manner, when we come to remember him. But to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this ſhould ſerve, I do not well underſtand, and without the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in us, the fleſh can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nothing at all though never ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and therefore I lay aſide ſuch thoughts, and content my ſelf to know, that they that are joyned (or cleave) to the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> are one ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now from this ſecret union that is here made between Chriſt and our perſons, it comes to paſs that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hath been accounted an earneſt and pledg of the reſurrection. For nothing that is made one with Chriſt can die and be loſt, but he will raiſe it up again at the laſt day. His ſpirit can find out all their duſt after a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31853:89"/>thouſand changes; it can gather all their diſperſons, and renuite their ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered crums, and knead them again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a goodly body.

                  <p>We ſhould think therefore when
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:31853:90"/>we go to the Table of the Lord, that we go to joyn our ſelves more cloſely to our head, and to unite our hearts more firmly to the fountain of our life.

We ſhould think that hereby we may get greater victories over our enemies, if we do not betray our ſuccours, that we may more compleat our conqueſts, if we uſe the power that is ſent unto us. We ſhould look upon this bread, as the bread of life, and conceive that we take the cup of immortality into our hands, and that the next draught may be in the Kingdom of God, when our bodies ſhall be raiſed to feaſt at the eternal ſupper of the Lamb. For this is but a juſt conſequence of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins (which the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treated of) that our bodies ſhould live again which became mortal through ſin.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:31853:90"/>wiſe aſſures us of the other, and gives unto us the earneſt of the Spirit. What joy then muſt theſe thoughts needs create in our ſouls? What better chear can we deſire? What greater dainties would we taſte then this holy feaſt affords? or what cauſe would we have of thankſgiving more then hath been named? If we deſire a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort in our thankſgivings, and to have an harmony of ſouls while we ſing his praiſes; if we would hear ſome voice beſides our own that might fill up our joys, and lift them to a greater height; That is not wanting neither, as the next Chapter ſhall declare.

                  <p>AS this Sacrament is a means of uniting us to our Lord by <hi>faith,</hi> ſo likewiſe of uniting us to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by <hi>love.</hi> It knits us not onely to our head, but all the members alſo thereby are more indeared unto each
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31853:91"/>other. We enter here into a ſtrict league of friendſhip with them, as well as into a Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>For all true Chriſtians are not onely of the Family of God, but his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and neareſt relations; ſo that we cannot profeſs any love unto the father of them all, but we muſt at the ſame time embrace his whole progeny, as bearing his character, and having in them thoſe very things which we love in him. When we take the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, we contract a kindred alſo with all the friends of the bridegroom. And love indeed is of that nature, that it is not onely diffuſive of it ſelf, but it runs forth with a certain pleaſure, and tickles our heart as it paſſeth from us. So that no man would be excuſed from loving of his brethren, nor willingly want that part of this Chriſtian feaſt. We all grant that this food would not be ſo full of juice and ſweetneſs, but that it taſtes of the Love of our Lord; nor would this cup be ſo pleaſant, but that it is the cup of Charity. Now when the heart is once filled with love, it wants nothing but objects whereon to empty it ſelf, and it is like new
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31853:91"/>wine that is ready to burſt the veſſel, unleſs it find ſome vent. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one good man is glad at ſuch a time to eaſe himſelf into the boſome of others, and to expreſs himſelf to them in ſuch charitable actions as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done to God who is all ſufficient of himſelf. This adds to the grace of this entertainment, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love to be ſeen in it. The food is <hi>love;</hi> the Maſter of the Feaſt glories in no greater name, then that <hi>he is Love;</hi> all the gueſts are Brethren; they are all in their Fathers houſe; they all receive the tokens and pledges of the Love of their Elder Brother; and his love is ſo great that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſhare his inheritance among them. It muſt be therefore againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the courſe of things, not to love, and to let our Brethren ſhare in our affections, who have a portion in the ſame Saviour.</p>
                  <p>But to make it plainly appear, that one end of the inſtitution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to advance love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our hearts to each other, let theſe things be conſidered:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. As it is a common feaſt, it carries
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31853:92"/>in it the notion of love and good will that is between all the gueſts. It is well known that eating and drinking together was anciently ſuch a ſign of unity, conjunction of minds and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſociety, that the word <hi>Companis,</hi> and <hi>Companio,</hi> in old Latine, is the ſame with <hi>Socius.</hi> Our Engliſh retains them all, and expreſſeth a more then ordinarily familiarity between perſons, by the names of <hi>companions, company</hi> and <hi>ſociety,</hi> which are firſt made and afterward maintained by a friendly converſe at the ſame table, and eating of the ſame Bread. And hence it is that all our <hi>Companies</hi> and <hi>Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in Cities have their <hi>Guild-halls</hi> where they meet, and their feaſts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at certain times for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of love and amicable correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. From which kind of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is that the holy Sacrament was called <hi>Synaxis,</hi> a convention or coming together in one, which the Apoſtle expreſſeth when he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. <gap reason="foreign">

Now the more ſacred our food is whereof we partake, and the body of Chriſt being broken before our eyes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto us, the more ſtrongly are we engaged to brotherly love, and the rarer friendſhip do we contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that the word <hi>companion</hi> can expreſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Paſchal ſupper among the Jews was a feaſt of <hi>love,</hi> as well as of <hi>remembrance.</hi> For it was not onely ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated between the members of the ſame family, but by the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who came together from all parts at the ſame time, and in one place;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31853:93"/>which did intimate to them that they were but one body. For this cauſe it is likely God ordained that they ſhould have one <hi>whole Lamb</hi> for every fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.46.</note> and not divide it into portions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſeveral companies; as alſo he forbids that a bone of it ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them. It did well repreſent the unity that was among them, ſeeing they all did the ſame thing without any diviſion, and made not the leaſt fraction in thoſe parts that were moſt compacted. The bread likewiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaven might have ſome ſuch ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification in it, that they ſhould not ſwell by the fervency of any paſſion, nor be ſowred by any malice or ill-will to each other who eat of the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread. And ſo the Apoſtle bids us to <hi>keep the feaſt</hi> (now that Chriſt our Paſſeover is ſacrificed for us) <hi>not with the leaven of malice and wickedneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi> And it may be obſerved, that though the ſtranger that was uncircumciſed might not by the Law eat of the Lamb (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.43, 45.) yet their <hi>Maſters</hi> tell us that they permitted them to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31853:94"/>eat of the unleavened bread, and bitter herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was a token of ſome love unto them, though not of ſuch a dear affection as they had for their own Nation.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. But the Lords Supper is much more a feaſt of love, becauſe it is a remembrance of the greateſt love that ever was, which our Lord ſhewed in dying for us. This love of his muſt in all reaſon be compenſated with a great love from us, and he hath made our Brethren to be his proxies and receivers; he hath transferred the debt that is owing him unto them, that we may do them thoſe kindneſſes for his ſake which we cannot do immediately unto him. It is worthy our notice, that the firſt perſon that ever received this holy Sacrament, was (in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood) St. <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he that lay in Jeſus his breaſt (and is therefore called by ſome Greek Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31853:94"/>Supper (ſpoken of <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.) our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour entertains his Diſciples the reſt of that night till he went into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with thoſe heavenly diſcourſes which you read in the 14, 15, 16, 17, Chapters of the ſame Goſpel. A great part of which contain the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of brotherly love, of living in peace, and being one with each other even as He and his Father are one; which may well ſuggeſt to our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that one intent of this heavenly repaſt is to breed in us a kind of coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial charity, and make us all like that Diſciple who firſt had the favour to taſte of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. This Supper is the more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant of Chriſtian charity and peace that is to be between all the gueſts, becauſe they all eat of <hi>one loaf,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. where <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31853:95"/>all Chriſtians united and compacted into one body, by partaking of that one and the ſame individual loaf. And therefore we may by the way take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the bread provided for our Communions (though never ſo great) ought to be but one loaf; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that all ſhould communicate (if it may be) at the ſame time, and not one part of a Congregation to day, and the other at the next meeting; for this doth not ſo well ſignifie the union that is among all Chriſtians who live together in the ſame ſociety.

And indeed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31853:95"/>there never was any ſociety of men ſo ſtrongly united and kneaded together, as the firſt body of Chriſtians were.

                  <p>And for this cauſe ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> the Apoſtle bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (in the place forecited) <hi>to ſalute each other with an holy kiſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.20.</note> becauſe there was ſuch vehement contentions and great differences among them.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:31853:97"/>obſerves, that the kiſs doth not onely unite thoſe that are divided, but it likewiſe makes an equality between thoſe that are unequal, which is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thing to all friendſhip.

                  <p>And I may obſerve alſo, that the very next words of the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. are an entreaty to mark all them who cauſe diviſion among them.

                     </gap>, what was that their dear affection which they did bear unto each other? This was more famed in the world then the noble band of lovers that died at each others ſide, and were ready to receive thoſe wounds into their own bodies, which were dealt to their companions. For they did not onely impart their goods, but their own ſelves, and were prepared to lay down their lives for the Brethren. And if the relief they beſtowed on each other were like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and ſacrifices to God (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18.)
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31853:106"/>then the giving of themſelves, was ſomething like the love of Chriſt, and too great a charity to be reſembled to any thing but his ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And there was another thing that was ſometime in uſe, which teſtified their love to all Chriſtians throughout the World. One Church ſent a loaf of bread to another, as a token of their conſent in faith, and their conſort in affection; which they that did receive, might conſecrate (if they thought good) and uſe at the miniſtration of the Sacrament, and thereby teſtifie their union with the reſt of the body of Chriſt that were diſtant from them.<note place="margin">Aug.

                  <p>We muſt think then when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to this heavenly banquet, that we are about to remember the deareſt love that ever was, and to engage our ſelves in the greateſt affection and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31853:107"/>ſtricteſt friendſhip that can be in any hearts unto each other. VVe muſt think that we enter into a mutual co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with our brethren, by eating of the ſame bread, and drinking of the ſame cup. And we muſt reſolve never to fall out any more, much leſs to hate, malign, or do deſpight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to one another; but to live more then ever in the peace of God, by a brotherly unity and affection. Let us think it as unnatural after ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fall out, as for the hands to ſcratch the face, or any one member to beat and tear the other inpieces.</p>
                  <p>And if there be any thing hitherto treated of in this diſcourſe, which men cannot or will not underſtand to be meant by this Sacrament, yet let us all apprehend that it is a bond of charity, and doth engage us not to quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch things. For it is a great policie of the Devil, to make that a bone of contention, which ſhould be the Bread of Love and Peace. It was intended to be a conteſſeration and union of Chriſtian Societies to God, and with one another; but mens <hi>evil taking of it;</hi> (as One well ſaith) <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31853:107"/>us from God, and the evil under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it divides us one from another.</hi> Thus much notwithſtanding the weakeſt mind may conceive, that it is a feaſt of love; and it is not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but wilfulneſs, nor ſhortneſs of underſtanding, but perverſneſs of heart that makes men ſenſeleſs in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. And therefore let us uſe one another as friends, and think our hands and tongues, and our very hearts are bound with cords of Love, which we cannot break without apparent vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to our ſelves. Remember always that a Rupture in this Sacred Bond of Brotherly Love, doth diſunite us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from our Lord himſelf. For there are not two cups whereof we drink at his Supper, the one containing the Love of Chriſt, the other the Love of our Brethren; but we drink both at one draught, and engage to both at one breath.

                  <head>Concluſion.</head>
                  <p>WHen I conſider all theſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable uſes of this holy food, I do not wonder if ſome devout perſons in the elder times, out of an exceſs of love, did <hi>by their daily bread</hi> (which we petition for in the Lords Prayer) underſtand this divine bread; and ſo out of a ſpiritual hunger, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of affection, did eat of it every day. For you ſee that herein we commemorate both to God and man the death of Chriſt; we publiſh it to the world, and plead it with God in our own behalf and others. Then this we have nothing more prevalent, ſo that our hearts begin (while we are commemorating of it, to burn with heavenly fires; and our tongues here taſt ſuch things, that make them ſing the praiſes of Angels. We ſeal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures between God and us. We give entertainment to our Lord Chriſt, and let him into our hearts; yea, we profeſs to all the world, that we are of his Religion and Communion. We are confirmed likewiſe in his favour:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:31853:108"/>he opens unto us his very heart; he lets us into his ſecrets, and knits us unto himſelf with a more inſeparable affection. We likewiſe aſſociate our ſelves with the Diſciples of our Lord, and make a firmer League of a holy friendſhip with them. All which may well make us ſay with the Diſciples, <hi>Lord, evermore give us this bread,</hi> But though it be ſo deſirable to feed alwayes on ſuch ſweetneſs, yet you cannot but diſcern, that this is a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that requires the greateſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our mind, and the ſtrongeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our heart, and layes the moſt weighty engagements upon us for our eternal good; and therefore muſt be well underſtood, and ſolemnly performed in our approaches to it.</p>
                  <p>For which cauſe, before I direct your Addreſſes to this Table (which is the next thing to be done, having opened to you the ſecrets of it) I will obſerve to you theſe two things for a concluſion of this part of my diſcourſe. The one, to quicken your appetite that you may feed heartily: The other, to guide your minds, that you may not feed upon ſhadows.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:31853:109"/>
                  <p n="1">1. This muſt needs be the moſt nouriſhing and ſtrengthning food of all others that a Chriſtian hath, becauſe there are ſo many ends and purpoſes to which it ſerves. It feeds all our Graces at once (as you ſhall hereafter ſee) and it ſends a nouriſhment (and that moſt plentifull and copious) to every part. It encreaſes our love to God, and our love to man, which is the ſum of all our duty: It engageth us in the moſt ſacred bands, by the dying of Chriſt, by his deareſt love, by all the bleſſings which he hath beſtowed, to do that duty, and faithfully perform it. It is a little Epitome of the whole Goſpel, for it ſhews what God will do for us, and what we moſt do for him, and it affords ſtrength unto us for to do it. And therefore it is called the New-Teſtament or Covenant in his blood, becauſe here the whole New Covenant is repreſented, God give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son and all Bleſſings unto us, and we giving of our ſelves and our beſt ſervice unto him, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcourſed. By this God ſets to his Seal, that all things contained in the Covenant ſhall be done for us;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:31853:109"/>and we do ſet to our ſeal, and openly profeſs our ſelves to belong to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that we eſteem and highly value all thoſe bleſſings, and will do any thing for to obtain them.</p>
                  <p>Now who would not long for ſuch a food that will ſatisfie our whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? Who would refuſe an invitation to that Table where all things are in one diſh (if I may ſo ſpeak) and God and Man meet together in one Bread and one Cup? But I doubt I may add, Who is there that would not have all theſe things, ſo that this Bread and Wine without any labour will convey them unto him? And therefore I muſt give you another ſhort information, which was the ſecond thing that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and that is this:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This copious Food doth not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh us, without ſome actions of our own, even ſuch as I have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Diſcourſe. It doth not feed us in a natural, but in a moral and ſpiritual manner. It reireſheth us by our conſideration, by our faith, our love, our prayers, our covenanting and thankſgiving. But all the cunning in the world will not draw a drop of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31853:110"/>blood out of it without theſe; no, it draws out the blood of our ſouls, and waſts our ſtrengths by a careleſs and prophane eating of it. The Papiſts talk of great things that their Prieſts give in this Sacrament by their power, and they would make the world believe, that they communicate more then we can do: But we muſt ſolemnly averr, <hi>That our Miniſtry conveighs as great things as they ſpeak of, onely men muſt do ſomething more of the work them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> We pretend not indeed to ſend wicked men to Heaven with a word; but we can help the thoughts and affections of all pious ſouls, as much as they with all their skill and power. Nay, if the people do nothing, we give them more then they; for they feed them with hungry accidents, they give them a bit of quantity, and a cup of colours; yea the Laity have not ſo much as a ſip of theſe figures; whereas the worſt man among us hath at leaſt Bread and Wine; ſo that the beſt among us enjoy as much in effect and vertue as they can pretend unto, and the worſt (by their own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) enjoy much more. But the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31853:110"/>truth of it is, that men have heightned theſe things to ſuch incomprehenſible myſteries, becauſe <hi>they</hi> would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and <hi>theſe</hi> ſhould do all. They have advanced theſe ſacred Rites of Chriſts appoinment, into a degree of vertue beyond all his other commands, that ſo by theſe eaſie and facile rites of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, men might go to Heaven by a compendious manner of doing little or nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſalvation. And they have not left theſe Rites as naked as Chriſt brought them into the world, but they have changed the manner of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, and cloathed them in a great many ſtrange dreſſes, leſt the genuine ſimplicity of them ſhould reprove their falſe hopes which they conceive from them. They could never put men ſo ſoon into Heaven, nor get ſo much money, as they do by the bargain, if they did not make men believe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things of this Sacrament, then of all the eternal Laws of Chriſt; and they could not make men believe ſo much more of it, if they did not transform it from its native ſimplicity, into an uncouth myſtery. Theſe two
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:31853:111"/>things, the love of mens luſts, and the love of the world, have made men ſtretch theſe things ſo far, as to defie all reaſon, to damn all thoſe that will not ſpeak non-ſence, and to ſend thoſe to hell (though of never ſo holy lives) that will not diſcredit their eyes and ears. What ſtrange things will men believe and do, ſo that they can but believe contrary to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? They hope to go to Heaven they know not how, by the Magick of words, and by the ſecret efficacy of a Religion that they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and this makes them willing to entertain ſuch Doctrines. And then others have a reſpect to their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt (and having little elſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their greatneſs) would be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and eſteemed for their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power in making the body of Chriſt, and that makes them willing to maintain them. So the Author of the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſaith very truly,<note place="margin">L. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>When men began to place Heaven below Earth, good inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions were ſaid to be corruptions onely tollerated by Antiquity; and abuſes brought in afterward, were canonized
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:31853:111"/>for perfect corrections.</hi> But we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly acknowledg that we have no power to ſave men without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We celebrate no ſuch My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries that ſhall convey the wicked to Heaven. We cannot deliver thoſe that are dead from their pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who whilſt they lived made little reckoning either of this or any other Divine Command. No, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to All men, that this food muſt nouriſh us by our own ſtomachs, that it affords ſtrength by the vital opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our own ſouls. And if we our ſelves will do what God requires of us, then we ſhall find it as full of vertue as we can deſire, and it will be a means to put us in Heaven while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here upon the earth. Sometimes they will needs blame us as doing too little, and denying the uſe of good works; but this is ſuch a falſity, that we call for more of mens labour then they ſeem to make neceſſary, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that we hope not by any power of ours to do them good, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their own powers. And therefore let us put forth a lively faith, let us heartily covenant with our Lord,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:31853:112"/>let us make a ſincere profeſſion of our Religion, and exerciſe ſuch other acts as I have been treating of, and ſo will this Feaſt be of great force, and full of efficacy to our ſouls health.</p>
                  <p>And that you may feed with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and hereby get an encreaſe in ſtrength, it is neceſſary that I next of all direct your Addreſſes to Gods Table, and ſhew how you ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your ſelves to be his worthy Gueſts; and that ſhall be the Subject of the following Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>If we conſider therefore with our ſelves a while, and look upon him that dwells in pure light, we ſhall ſoon be perſwaded that they ought to be holy that approach near to him, that no prophane foot ought to tread in his Sanctuary, and that an unhallowed mind cannot be the Temple where he ſhould dwell. A ſhort explanation of the Pſalmiſts words will make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that our minds do rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, when we ſo conclude.

A great deal of care is to be uſed when we go to feaſt with the King of Heaven, but that is not the greateſt, much leſs all the care of a Chriſtian. If God prepare a Supper, we ſhould prepare our ſelves to be fit gueſts (ſo much is reſolved upon by all) the onely danger is, leſt we do not think this preparation looks ſo far back as really it doth.<note place="margin">In Sept.

But truly, ſaith he, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is need of a great deal more time, to fit one for to feaſt in ſuch a manner as he ought, then this comes to. The manners and carriage are to be righly formed; his mind is to be apparelled, and his ſoul trimmed with brave notions, that his behaviour may be handſomely compoſed. Now it is far more hard to adorn the mind, then to adorn the body; to get a deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befitting our ſelves, then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear richly and gaylie clad. And therefore longer time then a year will be required to dreſs up a mans ſelf for to feaſt like a wiſe man or a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, even ſo much, till we can <gap reason="foreign">

What he ſaith in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is but my very ſence in the thing we are treating of. God makes an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and calls us to his board; we
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:31853:116"/>muſt therefore trim up our ſelves to meet the bridegroom of our fouls. But this preparation is not ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that can have any ſet quantity of time allotted wherein to make it (as of a month, a year, or the like ſpace) but ſo much is neceſſary as will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſouls to the image of Chriſt, and make us fit company for ſo holy a God. It is not the waſhing our cloathes a little before, the ſprucing up of our ſouls (as I may ſay) and the putting on of a fine and demure behaviour when we come thither, though we be never ſo filthy and ragged at other times: But <hi>a holy life is the true time for preparing</hi> our ſouls to be Gods gueſts. Whatſoever care and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we uſe, and whatſoever extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ornaments we put on immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before our approaches to him; yet that a conſtant good behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man is the main thing we are to look after, is the ſum of what I have to ſay in the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The firſt of which I have already begun, and it is nothing but this, <hi>That holineſs is to be a Chriſtians conſtant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,

We are not onely to make a ſolemn ſtir againſt a Sacrament, and then light candles to ſearch for the old leaven that it may be thrown out; but being by Chriſt become unleavened, we are conſtantly to maintain ſuch a light ſhining in our hearts, that not we may live, but Chriſt may live in us, and the life that we lead may be by faith of the Son of God. Before a great feſtival the worſt of Heathens had their <hi>Votivae noctes, their ſevere and pure nights</hi> (as their Authors call them) ten of which together uſed to precede the feaſt of <hi>Iſis,</hi> in which time (as if they had imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated

                     <note place="margin">Orat. in Timoer.</note> An illuſtrious place there is in <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to this purpoſe, which I cannot but mention becauſe it will teſtifie ſo much againſt the Chriſtian world. <q>Before men come (ſaith he) to their holy offices, they abſtain for a certain number of days from all filthineſs and vile acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whereas they who go about holy things, ſhould not onely for ſome ſpace of time, <gap reason="foreign">

When I think of the <hi>Perſians</hi> (who they ſay) every year had a feaſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they deſtroyed all the Serpents that could be found, and then let them multiply as faſt as they would till the ſame ſolemnity returned again; It puts me in mind of the Religion that is moſt in faſhion among them that are named after Chriſt. They are very angry at the Devil and all his curſed brood, they are in ſome mood at a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn feaſt, mightily incenſed againſt the old Serpent; but afterwards they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:31853:118"/>patiently ſuffer him to take his reſt and his luſts increaſe like the ſpawn of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without any conſiderable diſtaſte or oppoſition. Theſe men are as much miſtaken in the Chriſtian life, as they that miſtake a Serpent for an Eele, or a ſtone for bread. God expects (and ſo he juſtly may) that we ſhould abound in all the fruits of righteouſneſs that are by Chriſt Jeſus to his praiſe and glory,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.11.</note> and that we ſhould paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.17.</note> abſtaining as pilgrims and ſtrangers from <hi>fleſhly</hi> luſts that war againſt the ſoul.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing that I would have obſerved is, <hi>that this holineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of actions of divers ſorts,</hi> and <hi>is expreſsed in different manners.</hi> It is diverſified not onely by the objects about which it is imployed, but the ſtate of the ſubject wherein it is will not permit that all the acts of it ſhould be of one kind and value. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was that I ſaid, the Actions of a holy life are not equal in their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Some of them reſpect God, others our neighbours, and the reſt our ſelves; and all theſe we can do at ſome times with a better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:31853:119"/>and greater devotion, then at other times it is poſſible for us to do. For we begin this life of holineſs when we are baptized into the Chriſtian faith, and take upon us thoſe ſacred ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>We are ever after this under a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious tie and vow; and the next ſtep which we take to the diſcharge of it, is to be catechized and inſtructe in Chriſts Religion, which is all that a child is capable of. And then when we come to years of diſcretion, we are to advance ſtill forward to a ſerious profeſſion that we ſtand to our firſt Covenant, and will be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our Lord. Now all our life after is but an aſſerting of our truth and ſincerity in this holy Covenant, and a making good our promiſe and oath wherein we have bound our ſelves. Which when we labour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly to perform, then do all the actions of our lives become holy. And ſo a man may be holy in his ſhop, by diligence and juſtice; and at his board by temperance, thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſending portions to the poor. A friendly, innocent and uſeful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:31853:119"/>will make him holy abroad; and meditation and prayer mixed with the former, will make him ſo at home. Yea, prudence, and the ends of health and cheerfulneſs will make his ſports and recreations, his ſleep and all ſuch actions to be holy, and not be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among paſtimes, but the neceſſary ſeaſons of doing little or nothing, that afterward we may do ſomething and be worthily employed. As to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition then of his heart, a Chriſtian is alway alike holy (becauſe he ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſires, intends and endeavours to be undefiled in all things) onely the matter about which he is neceſſarily employed will not bear it, that all his actions ſhould alway be alike excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. There is another thing likewiſe that muſt be confeſſed, That <hi>though all actions of holineſs have a regard to God as they are parts of our obedience to his commands; yet ſome of them have a more particular reſpect to him, and are more induſtriouſly intended to his honour.</hi> Though all holy actions look towards him; yet ſome of them are a looking him directly in the face.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:31853:120"/>Though we may always fit under his ſhadow with great delight, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we are under the light of his countenance it ſelf; his glory is to be alway our end, but ſometimes we are ſaid more particularly to glorifie his Name. As when we advance him highly in our own thoughts, or when we proclaim his excellencies to the world. When we pay our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to him for bleſſings received, or wait on his bounty for things that we need. In brier, prayer and praiſes, meditation of him, and deſires after him, reading and hearing of his holy Word, with ſuch like actions, me of that ſort wherein we behold his face, and do more ſenſibly taſte of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are both more ſatisfied with him as the greateſt ſweetneſs, and transformed into him as the pureſt beanty.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:31853:120"/>that <hi>thoſe actions which reſpect men or our ſelves, and thoſe which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſpect God, are mutual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations each to other.</hi> As an holy behaviour in the works of our calling, in our converſes with men, and the uſe of Gods bleſſings, diſpoſe us unto prayer, meditation, and ſuch like du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: ſo prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> again requires them, and returns the kindneſs upon their own heads, by diſpoſing and preparing us to ſuch like holy deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the future in theſe matters. Theſe two are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable brotherhood, like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his twins, that grow or decay both together. Prayer makes a Chriſtian live holily, and a holy life makes us fit to pray ſervently. And both the one and the other are not onely parts of our duty which God commands, but inſtruments and helps to doing our duty. Such a combination there is between all the things that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, to make them eaſie and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, deſirable and pleaſant, and to make us intire and compleat, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and univerſal in our obedience to him. VVe cannot do one duty that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:31853:121"/>he bids us, but the reſt become more eaſie to be done; nor love ſincerely one command, but the reſt will draw us unto their love. The holineſs of our converſation is it ſelf an invitation of God to our ſouls, much more when we ſecond it with the attractives of holy prayers and affectionate deſires: And both the ſweetneſs of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with God, and the power of his grace that is conſequent upon our hearty deſires, will ingage and inable us to continue an holy converſation. As impurity brings us into familiarity with the Devil, ſo holineſs brings us into fellowſhip with God; and the happineſs of that is ſo great, that we ſhall not be tempted eaſily to leave it, but be excited to do all we can for to maintain it. <hi>Pſellus</hi> I remember tells us, that the mad fellows of <hi>Manes,</hi> and others, frantickly and diabolically acted, uſed to eat the excrements of a man; and being asked the reaſon of it, they made no anſwer but this, that to thoſe that eat ſuch things <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the ſpirits were made friendly and benevolent.</hi> I am ſure the Devil delights in thoſe who
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:31853:121"/>feed upon the filth of the world; and the very prayers of ſuch perſons are but a ſtrange charm or ſpell that have a force to hold them faſter in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils arms. While men pray with any affection to ſinne, or with no diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to it, they will but the more certainly continue in it, and never think of forſaking that which they hope their prayers have deſpoiled of all power to do them any harm. They think they have conjured out all the bitterneſs, all the ſting and the fire that is in ſin by that holy breath, and ſo they take the confidence to embrace and kiſs it as an harmleſs thing. But a holy man (as I ſaid) is Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and he takes pleaſure in thoſe that fear him. And therefore all the Religious acts of a pious ſoul, make his ordinary Employments to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and pleaſing unto God, and they again have an influence upon his acts of Worſhip to make them more full of devotion and true fervour. As wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actions do nouriſh in ſome moſt paſſionate prayers for forgiveneſs, and thoſe prayers they hope obtain leave for them to do wickedly upon no
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:31853:122"/>greater charge than to ask forgiveneſs: So good actions do beget in men a greater longing after the divine grace, and theſe deſires make them ſtill do well out of a hope to have more grace. When a good man lifts up his hands to God, he draws down God into his ſoul that he may work with his hands that which is good in his employment, and he is not ſo buſie in that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that his hands ſhould grow ſo heavy or dirty by it, as to be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or unfit to lift them up again to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>We are to look then after ſuch a demeanour, that we may be fit at all times when God ſhall give us an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to wait upon him: our life muſt be ſo framed, that one piece of them may well fit and fall in with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as it is with a Table or ſome ſuch thing that is taken in pieces and disjointed upon occaſion, but may preſently be ſet together, and all the parts will come into their proper places without much noiſe and trouble; So it ſhould be with our lives, though one piece of them be diſtant from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of our various buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:31853:122"/>yet when our neceſſities do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, we ſhould be able without much labour to join the moſt different parts together with the reſt, and not be forced to ſpend our time, to plain and ſmooth, and knock (as I may ſpeak) our hearts together, when we ſhould be in a holy frame, and be ſpending our time in the enjoyment of our greateſt good. I mean by all this, that our worldly employments muſt not hinder our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but rather be a means to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and promote it; ſo that where they end, it may take its place, and fall in as if that room were prepared for it.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. It is to be acknowledged, that <hi>even of thoſe holy actions which reſpect God, ſome are neceſſary, and ſome vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi> i. e. ſome are of that nature, that unleſs we do them, we cannot be <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but others of them will make us excellent. Some are ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we cannot be ſaved unleſs we do them; others are aſpirations after a greater glory. Thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an expreſs command, are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly neceſſary to our happineſs, and thoſe actions of piety that are free and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:31853:123"/>uncommanded, I look upon as ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our happineſs, and without which we may be much in danger to neglect the moſt neceſſary. By theſe Acts which are <hi>voluntary,</hi> (that I may avoid all quarrel) I underſtand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the higher degrees of thoſe acts which are <hi>neceſsary,</hi> unto which I imagine that no man will take himſelf to be at all times abſolutely engaged. And yet if at ſome ſeaſons they be not performed, it may hazard our eſtate, though not certainly expoſe it to ruine. Such Free-will-offerings there were among the Jews, which were onely larger expreſſions of their gratitude in the ſame things wherein at other times they did uſe to manifeſt it. And that they were a piece of Gods Worſhip and Service, though not particularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him, is apparent from the direction that God gives about them when they ſhould be brought unto him. But theſe Laws that God makes for their right and acceptable perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, do again ſhow, that he expected them from his friends, though he did not abſolutely enjoin them. To pray then, or to meditate and give praiſe to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:31853:123"/>God, are things of an unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment: But by longer ſtudy and pains to raiſe our hearts to a greater intention of mind, to greater expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of love, to higher and more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime admirations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that which I call free, but yet fit at ſome ſeaſons. As it is in Almes-giving, ſo it is in theſe other holy duties. There ſeems to be a certain portion which we are bound to give to poor people, or elſe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud them of their due; but it is fit alſo that we ſhould enlarge our Charity beyond the bounds of meer neceſſity, leſt by being Niggards, at laſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Thieves, and by doing no more than is due, we be tempted ſometimes to do leſs. And ſo the Jews diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charity into two ſorts, one of which they called <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which was exactly according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the other they called <hi>Mercy</hi> or Bounty, being above the proportion the Law required. According to which notion, he that performed the firſt ſort was named a <hi>Juſt Man;</hi> and he that performed the later was named <hi>Good.</hi> The Prieſts lived upon Gods Almes, and he aſſigned unto them a great part
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:31853:124"/>of that Maintenance which the Jews brought to him; and though I might give other inſtances of Charity, yet I ſhall chuſe to inſtance in one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them, becauſe leſs obſerved. The Law required that they ſhould give the firſt-fruits of their Land unto the Prieſt as his receiver, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 38.4. Though the quantity of them be not there determined, yet becauſe <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.13.) that they ſhould offer <hi>the ſixth part of an Ephah of an Homer,</hi> their wiſe men have reſolved that they were bound to bring at leaſt a ſixtieth part to God for his Miniſters; for an Ephah is the tenth part of an Homer.<note place="margin">V. <hi>Seld.</hi> Hiſt. of Tythes. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in Numb. 18.12.</note> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, they account him but a covetous man that brought no more; and they called this a <hi>Terumah (or Heave-offering)</hi> of an evil eye. For thus <hi>Maimon</hi> writes; <hi>A good eye,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> a liberal perſon) brings one part of forty, <hi>a mean eye</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> a man that hath ſome goodneſs) one of fifty; and <hi>an evil eye</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> a niggard) one of ſixty; leſs than which it was not lawfull for him to give. Therefore the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> thus exhorts, <hi>Give
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:31853:124"/>the Lord his honour with a good eye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 35.8.</note> and <hi>diminiſh not the firſt fruits of thy hand, i. e.</hi> do not ſtint thy ſelf to a meer Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal righteouſneſs in giving God his firſt fruits; however grudge not to give him ſo much as the Law requires. This Doctrine of theirs is a good rule for us to ſquare ſuch actions by. We muſt do what Juſtice reduires, and give ſo much as we in conſcience think God abſolutely exacts of us, but we ſhould ſometimes extend our hand beyond that which the Scripture calls <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and by liberality come up to the degree of <hi>good men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. D. <hi>Ham.</hi> Sermon of Poor mans Tything.</note> Now we cannot well think that God requires a leſs portion of us then he did of the Jews, who once in three years gave a tythe to the poor; and therefore if any one will bind himſelf to a thirtieth part of his yearly encreaſe (which is the ſame with a triennial tythe) yet it will be fit that he make ſome free-will offerings, and not confine himſelf to ſuch a ſcantling, which he hath tied his hands unto, leſt he ſhould fall ſhort of them through his careleſneſs. And the one of theſe he looks upon as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe elſe he may be worſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:31853:125"/>than a Jew, yea than a Jew of an evil eye; and the other as a voluntary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the honour of God, who doth for us not onely more than we deſerve, but more than we deſire.</p>

And though it be not ſaid in the Bible, how often in the day we ſhould be upon our knees; yet all good men (that I know or ever heard of) do think, that nothing leſs than a morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Worſhip can denominate prayer continual or without ceaſing. As the Lambs that were offered every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and every evening throughout the year, were called in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law <hi>the continual burnt-offering,</hi> Exod. 29.42. Numb. 28.3. So the offering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God our Morning and Evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, even the calves of our lips, for what we want, and what we have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:31853:125"/>received, may be called our <hi>continual prayer,</hi> which muſt be alwayes joined (according to the Apoſtle) with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. From their practiſe we fetch the beſt explication of theſe expreſſions concerning prayer, that I know of, and ſo we may of ſuch things as I before mentioned, and many others alſo. Theſe ſolemn Addreſſes then we may by no means omit, but look upon our ſelves as neceſſarily bound unto them. And as among them there were two Lambs more offered upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, over and above the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Burnt-offering, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 28.8, 9.) So we cannot but think our ſelves moſt ſtrictly enjoined to enlarge our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and praiſes upon the Lords day, to a greater length than at other times, and to offer as many more ſacrifices as other days require. Several other times there were wherein God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more than the ordinary offerings of them (as may be ſeen in the ſame Chapter) but yet he left room for ſome voluntary Oblations, which (as I ſaid) he thought they would be ſo kind as to beſtow upon him, or elſe he would never have made mention of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:31853:126"/>them, nor given any Laws about them. Even ſo hath God left it to our love and good will we bear to him, to make choice of ſome ſeaſons (beſide thoſe he hath appointed) wherein to pay him larger acknowledgments, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a more abundant affection to his ſervice, both by the fervency of our ſouls in what we do, and by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion of time which we allow for the doing of it.<note place="margin">Pral. 119.164. and in the 108 verſe, he prayes God to accept the <hi>Free-will-offerings</hi> of his mouth.</note> And therefore it will be highly accepted of God, if ſometimes we pray with <hi>David</hi> ſeven times in a day, and make ſome addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the daily ſacrifice. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, though a perſon of a high em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment (as <hi>David</hi> was) uſed to continue ſo long at his private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and was ſo ſparing in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſpeech, that his Courtiers were wont to ſay,<note place="margin">Chytreus Orat. de eo.</note> he did <hi>ſaepius cum Deo, quam hominibus loqui,</hi> ſpeak oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with God, than he did with men. The more pious ſort likewiſe among the Jews, ſeem to have prayed at leaſt four times in a day, twice at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they were at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and twice in their own private houſes. At the third hour when the Diſciples were
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:31853:126"/>together (at the Temple it is very probable, becauſe all Nations that were at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> took notice of it) the holy Ghoſt came down upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.15. which was the time of the morning ſacrifice, about nine of the clock, according to our reckoning. On the ſame day (in all likelihood) two of the Apoſtles went into the Temple at another hour of Prayer, which was the ninth, (<hi>viz.</hi> three of the clock in the afternoon,<note place="margin">

And if it ſhould be ſaid, That he being not at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> but <hi>Joppa,</hi> might omit
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:31853:127"/>the hours of prayer at the Temple, that will be confuted by the practiſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> (in the ſame Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, &amp; 30.) who being at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> prayed at the ninth hour, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle cannot be thought to be leſs devout than him. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing loſt by going unto God; and the oftner we perſwace our ſelves to it, the better ſucceſs we ſhall have in all other things, according to a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb (of the <hi>Dutch</hi> I think) which ſaith, <hi>Thefts never enrich, Alms ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impoveriſh, Prayer hinders no work.</hi> Our Saviour hath given us an example of extraordinary devotion in his own practiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. where you read that he continued all night in prayer to God, or (as <gap reason="foreign">

He did not ſin when he ſlept other nights, but this was a more illuſtrious act of holineſs, and a more fervent expreſſion of love to his Father, above that which the precept requires. And concerning ſuch devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:31853:127"/>the Mahometans ſay, <hi>Preces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnae ſunt ſplendor dici; Night-prayers are the light of the day.</hi> So in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.41. we find that our Lord fell upon his knees and prayed; and not long after, ver. 44. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>he prayed more earneſtly and fervently than before.</hi> He did not fail of his duty in the former prayer, becauſe it was not in ſuch a vehement degree; but in this later prayer he expreſſed a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent zeal and ardor of ſpirit then he was abſolutely tied unto. All theſe things are written for our inſtruction, that we may learn to lay hold on the occaſions that are preſented to us, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our ſpirits, &amp; raiſing our hearts beyond their common pitch and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I remember <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith concerning the ancient <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they uſed to ſacrifice to <hi>Diomedes</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

We muſt alway be holy and pure in our Addreſſes to the Divine Majeſty; but we have examples in Scripture (and it will be highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto him) to put to greater
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:31853:128"/>ſtrength ſometimes, and preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a greater ſpeed; to collect all the forces of our ſouls, and ſtrain them to the nobleſt degree of deſire and love that we are able.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. You may likewiſe conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That one act of Religion is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to another.</hi> The <hi>daily</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice makes the <hi>weekly</hi> more acceptable. Continual prayer makes us more fit for prayer on the Lords day. The morning and evening ſpent well, make us ready to ſpend a whole day better. And theſe conſtant ſacrifices keep the Altar warm, and maintain a fire to kindle our free-will-offerings. And one free-will-offering inflames our heart to a forwardneſs to preſent God with another. So likewiſe back again, theſe extraordinary devotions make us more ſolemn in our ordinary duties; and the Lords day employed well, makes every day to be ſpent the better.</p>
                  <p>Meditation and retired thoughts fit us for prayer; and prayer again nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and feeds our meditations. Both thoſe fit us to receive holy exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and uſefull inſtructions in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and they again ſtir us up to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:31853:128"/>more frequency and fervency in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and meditation. And theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the former that I have mentioned, prepare us for the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and the keeping the holy Feaſt of Chriſtians in the Supper of the Lord. This again affords ſuch nutriment, that it makes us ſtrong in the Grace of Chriſt, and to perform all other duties with a greater guſt and reliſh, with more delight to God, and unto our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. But it muſt alſo be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That there is ſome other prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requiſite to holy duties, beſide all this that I have mentioned.</hi> For though fervency in any one duty of our Religion, doth but fit us to be more fervent in all the reſt; and though the works of our employment conſcientiouſly diſcharged, do fit us for the duties of Religion, yet to the doing of them fervently, it is needfull that we lay out of our mind all other thoughts that concern not them. Now the works of our ordinary employment being about a different matter from the works of devotion, and the mind full of one thing, not being able pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31853:129"/>to be void for other company, we muſt ſpend ſome time to diſcharge our thoughts of ſuch objects as are alien to theſe holy duties we go about. Conſtancy in our lawfull buſineſs doth hinder many indiſpoſitions and ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in our minds, that elſe would grow up in us; but yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may leave ſome little indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in us, at leaſt to ſuch a fervency in devotion as we would ariſe unto. They therefore muſt be turned out of doors, and the thoughts of them muſt be laid aſide, that God may come in and poſſeſs himſelf of us. The Altar of God (<hi>Exod.</hi> 27.4, 5.) was made with a grate in the midſt of it, that let the aſhes fall through, ſo that the fire might burn hotter and more purely. But yet for all this, it is moſt likely that the ſacrifice would need ſome ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that ſo the aſhes might be ſhaken off more perfectly, and it more entirely conſumed (and therefore you read of fleſh-hooks among the Utenſils of the Altar, wherewith the Prieſt ordered the fleſh while it burn in the fire:) Juſt ſo it is with our hearts, in which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fire ought to burn; though
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:31853:129"/>they be like a grate or ſeive, and let worldly thoughts paſs through and run out of them, which elſe like aſhes would make the flame to be dimme and pale; yet beſides this care, there will be need of ſome ſhaking and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of our ſelves, that we may more fully clear our hearts of all thoſe earthly cloggs that will ſtick and cling unto us. Now the higher that holy act of worſhip is which we are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and the ſeldomer it doth return to be performed, and the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that expreſſion of love is which we would make in it; the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn muſt be our preparation, and the larger time there muſt be allowed, for taking our minds from other things, and bringing them to a ſerious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon this alone. And therefore ſince our approaches to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are of ſuch moment, and ſince they profit us not without the operation of our own mind, and that benefit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo great when we come aright, it cannot be thought but that we ſhould uſe a great care and circumſpection to fit our ſelves for ſuch near converſes, eſpecially ſince they are not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:31853:130"/>performed as other duties. And yet in this preparation there is alſo a latitude, ſo that I cannot well determine how much is of abſolute neceſſity to be done; and if I ſhould, ſtill we may go beyond thoſe limits, and perform more acceptable ſervice unto God.</p>
                  <p>If you would know now after all that hath been ſaid, wherein prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his holy duty doth more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſiſt; I may briefly reſolve you about it thus; <hi>We muſt deny to our ſelves lawfull things,</hi> by ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves from our ordinary buſineſs, by abſtinence from food, and from the moſt chaſt embraces which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. And this muſt be done for no other end, but that we may more fully know the eſtate of our ſouls (which I ſuppoſe we are already acquainted withall) and be more deeply appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of the evil of ſin, and more ſorrowfully bewail it, and more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally reſolve againſt it. That we may pray with greater appetite, and praiſe his Name with a more delicious reliſh when we diſtaſt all other things:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:31853:130"/>and in ſhort that by disburdening of our bodies, we may aſcend up to Heaven with greater felicity in our thoughts and meditation.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe preparation to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſts body and blood is the prime end of this diſcourſe; I ſhall next deſcend to treat of that, and in the following Chapter conſider what greater degree of holineſs may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived requiſite to the right perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that Chriſtian duty.</p>

                  <p>And beſides this, Seeing it is the deſign of a Chriſtian in this duty, to get as near to Heaven as he can, it is the more neceſſary that he not only lay aſide his buſineſs, but his body too.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:31853:131"/>but by a ſolemn heart. So that this ſeparation from our buſineſs before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, ſeems to come within ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a neceſſary duty.</p>
                  <p>And give me leave to tell you, that it would be a thing of ſingular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if thoſe that have ſo much room in their houſes, would ſet ſome little place apart for holy duties, and let it be acquainted with no other thoughts, but only of God and their own ſouls. This would be an eaſie way of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all our employments out of our thoughts, which would all leave us when we came to that place where they were ſtrangers. None of them would be ſo bold as to tread in that place, which is waſht with tears; they would not draw breath, nor live in that place where there is no aire but Sighs and Prayers; they would never abide in that room where no inhabitant is but God alone. For we find that if we come to any place where ſomething of note and concernment hath been done by us, though it be ſlipt out of our mindes, the very ſight of the place revives the image of that thing, and ſtirres it up again in our memories.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:31853:132"/>If therefore we had a place of privacy, where we did nothing but read and pray, and invite God into our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as ſoon as ever we did but look into it, the face of God would meet us, and we ſhould be ſtruck with a certain awe and reverence from his preſence that uſes to be there with us. And a ſweet remembrance alſo of what pleaſure hath paſſed there either in joy or ſorrow, would by a kind of natural way be revived. But if a man pray in his Counting-houſe, the thoughts of his money will be apt to meet him as ſoon as he ſteps in at the door, his bills and bonds will thruſt themſelves into his mind as ſoon as the Book of God, ſo that he will find it more difficult to drive away ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent thoughts. Let us therefore reſolve on this as the firſt ſtep to the Lords Table, to ſeparate our ſelves at leaſt from all worldly employments, if not from worldly places. If we cannot have a little Chappel in our own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet let us look to that in our own heart, that nothing now but God do enter into it. Say thus in your own meditations; Be gone you vain things,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:31853:132"/>for I am going to my God. Yea Lord, do thou bid them to be gone, and not dare to appear in thy preſence. Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come holy thoughts and pure deſires! O happy time wherein I may embrace my deareſt love, and ſolace my ſelf in the armes of my Saviour! I charge you O my companions, that you haſte away as faſt as the Hinds or the Roes, and that you ſtir not, or diſturb the beloved of my ſoul. Come not near I charge you; make no noiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him, or to call me away from his enjoyment. It is the voice of my beloved; I hear him inviting of me to his houſe of banquets, I ſee him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to entertain me; let all fleſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſilent, and not be ſo bold as to whiſper in his preſence.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. When you are thus at leiſure, <hi>ſet your ſelf to conſider what is the end of this Rite, and what lieth hid under the Ceremony.</hi> This one thing ſeems to me to call for ſome ſolemn thoughts beforehand; becauſe it is a piece of our Religion that is cloathed with an outward garment; it hath ſomething of a poſitive inſtitution in it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſomething of the ceremony, the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:31853:133"/>ſignification of which is to be ſtudied, leſt we ſhould not <hi>diſcern the Lords body.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19.</note> If we look not beyond the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, we ſhall feed nothing but our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; or if we draw aſide the veil but half way, we ſhall loſe a great part of the food of our ſouls, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by every part of this holy action. You muſt therefore labour to uncover the face of this myſterious food, and conſider it in all thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein I have laid it open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. This I judge to be the more needfull (together with the reſt of thoſe directions which I have to add) becauſe now this Feaſt doth return more ſeldome then it did in ancient times; and ſo our minds may have let ſlip the remembrance of many of the ends of it, or at leaſt may retain but weak and dark notions of them. For thoſe things that are not of natural light, do not uſe to ſtick ſo cloſe to our ſouls, as thoſe that are engraven upon them; but by the intervening of other images they may be either blotted out, or elſe look more pale, and loſe the livelineſs of their colour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had need the oftner to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:31853:133"/>on them, that ſo by a new impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they may keep their form, and then eſpecially when we are going ſo near to God, leſt our acquaintance with them be decayed through the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of other things that we have converſe withall. Let every man then remember himſelf when he intends to remember Chriſt, and ſay after this ſort, O my ſoul! whither are we going? What is that Table which I ſee yonder ſpread for us? What means that broken bread that is provided? For what end did his precious blood run out of his ſide? Do men uſe to drink a cup of blood? O my ſoul! let us enter into this ſecret, and know the bottom of this myſtery! Let us look into his wounds with joy and gladneſs, to ſee how his heart doth beat with love to us. Let us open our heart to him; let us ſhew him how ſorry we are, and how our heart is pierced, that we have pierced him. Let us lay our hearts together, and tye our ſelves in an everlaſting Covenant, that he may dwell in us, and we in him. Such as theſe are moſt ſeaſonable meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to diſpoſe our minds the better to feaſt with him.</p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:31853:134"/>
                  <p n="3">III. And then thirdly, <hi>We ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with our ſelves, what acts are moſt proper when we ſhall be at Gods Table.</hi> We ſhould think with our ſelves, what hatred of ſin, what deſire, what love to God, and what Charity to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is then to be expreſſed; what prayers and interceſſions, what prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and thankſgivings are then to be offered. For we ſhall ſcarce ſpend our time well there, unleſs we be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with ſome matter for our thoughts, and have put them into ſome method and order that they may not hinder one another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good to conſider with our ſelves, what diſpoſition of ſoul doth beſt agree with every part of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred action. How the mind is to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the breaking of the bread, and the pouring out of the wine; how it is to be moved when the Miniſter bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and preſents them unto God; and how when he gives and diſtributes them unto us and the reſt of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> Of which and ſuch like things I ſhall treat hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. And when we have diligently pondered of this, <hi>let us begin to ſtir
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:31853:134"/>up thoſe affections beforehand,</hi> which will prepare us to a more lively expreſſion of them when we come there. Begin to admire at Gods goodneſs; that he will ſend an invitation to ſuch a poor wretch as thou art. Render him many thanks, for that being a Lord of ſuch Majeſty, he would vouchſafe with ſo much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to come and dwell in ſuch a hole as our fleſh; and that he would love us better then his life, and that he will not forget us now that he lives in Heaven. Shew him what a pitiful poor creature thou art, and crave him humble pardon that thou ſhouldeſt put him to much pains and trouble. And intreat him now that he will not be offended at all the noiſome ſmells and loathſome ſights that are in a ſoul ſo ſick and diſeaſed as thine into which he is entring. Declare to him freely all thy maladies, and beſeech him that he will not diſdain thee, but come and cure thee. Profeſs to him ſincerely all the love that ever thou canſt, and importune him of all loves that he would make thee love him more. And then imagine with thy ſelf that he is graciouſly come to ſuch a naſty place
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:31853:135"/>as thy heart is, and ſo begin to bleſs and praiſe his Name for ſo high a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; reſolving likewiſe that thou wilt never ceaſe to praiſe him as long as thou haſt a day to live, and that when thy tongue ſhall falter, thou wilt think his praiſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe meditations and holy aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after him, will be like to the ſweet incenſe and odoriferous exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that perfume the houſe before the entrance of ſo worthy a gueſt. Or rather they will be as the harbingers of the King of Glory, that come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the rooms, and make them clean and ſweet for his entertainment. For as you ſee the Sun doth not onely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the world when he is above the Horizon, but a whole hour before his riſing, and as much after his ſetting, affords his comfortable light unto us: So the Son of Righteouſneſs, who is under theſe clouds of bread and wine, doth not only irradiate our minds when we actually receive this Sacrament, but doth appear before unto us (if we will look toward him) and makes it day in our ſouls by hopes and deſires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; and again he leaves ſome
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:31853:135"/>ſweet beams behind him afterward, by a remembrance how kind he hath been unto us in ſatisfying our deſires.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. And then (to ſpeak more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly) every man ſhould conſider with himſelf, <hi>how God hath proſpered him in his eſtate,</hi> and ſo lay aſide ſuch a portion for the poor, as bears ſome proportion to the bleſſing God hath afforded upon his labours. This was a great piece of this ſolemnity in ancient times, as hath been already ſaid from the Apoſtles mouth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. which place I heartily wiſh every man would more ſerionſly peruſe. This practiſe I know continues in the Chriſtian Church, though I fear it falls ſhort both of the liberality and open-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that was then in uſe, as alſo of the gain and increaſe that God makes to our eſtates. Let me therefore here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mind the pious Reader, that every mite that is given to the poor, is a grain of that incenſe that perfumes the houſe of God; and therefore ſuch charity is called <hi>an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God,</hi> Phil. 4.18. And ſo the Angel ſaith unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:31853:136"/>prayers and alms <hi>were come up</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>for a memorial before God.</hi> Three remarkable forms of ſpeech there are in thoſe words, to denote that they are a ſacrifice or oblation which we make to the giver of all good, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are given in the hands of prayer, as at the holy Euchariſt they ought to be. Firſt, They were <hi>for a memorial,</hi> which is an expreſſion we read in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (Lev. 2.9. and many other places) to denote that part of the meat offering that was burnt upon the Altar for a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto the Lord. Secondly, They are ſaid to <hi>come up</hi> or <hi>aſcend,</hi> which was proper to the Sacrifices that were burnt on the Altar, and went up to Heaven in pillars of ſmoak and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour. And thirdly, They did come up <hi>before God,</hi> which ſignified their acceptance, and that they were a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſacrifice unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>From heace it was that the Ancients ſometimes call the Lords Table by the name of an <hi>Altar,</hi> becauſe they laid upon it theſe Sacrifices or Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings (which at firſt were bread and wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afterward changed into
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:31853:136"/>money) part of which did furniſh the Table, and the reſt relieve the poor and thoſe that did miniſter unto the Lord. For then the cuſtom was for Chriſtians to make the Miniſter their <hi>Almoner</hi> or ſteward, to diſtribute their Charity as his prudence thought moſt fit. Now if we think it not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to intruſt them, yet we ſhould judg it moſt neceſſary when we go to this holy feaſt, to lay aſide ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable portion, as a juſt expreſſion of our great engagements unto God, and the charity which he hath exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards us. For ſince Almes are a ſacrifice, there muſt be ſome time to fit them and prepare them for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; and ſince they are ſo acceptable to him as to be accounted a memorial by him, we ſhould be the more liberal, and conſider upon ſome free-will offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to be brought into his treaſury. And the truth is, no man can be called liberal that is not ſo upon advice and deliberation. Theſe acts of Charity are to flow from counſel as well as any other. And therefore beforehand we ſhould determine what to give; and not throw in a piece of money as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:31853:137"/>it happens into the poor mans ſtock. If we could but believe, that this giving to God is a beneficial trade, and that he who ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6.) and that the more we have in his bank, the better we ſhall thrive; then we ſhould caſt in our minds how to make an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this way, and be deſirous to have a ſtock going in his hands. Then there would not need ſo much intreaty that men would caſt up their accounts in ſome meaſure before they go to the Table of God, and conſider how God hath bleſſed them and encreaſed their eſtates, and conſult how they may further augment them in ſuch an eaſie and ſure way as this appears to be. Sit down then I beſeech you, in a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, and look over your wealth, and think with your ſelf, how much land or money you are intruſted withall. Spread it before your thoughts, and ſay, All this hath God given me, and long preſerved it from thieves and fire, and other violences; he is daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto this heap, and giving more; what therefore out of all this, ſhall I return to him? I aſſure you it is a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:31853:137"/>piece of ſpiritual employment for a man to think on his baggs, if it be in order to filling the poor mans box. Say therefore thus to thy ſoul when thou art alone, God hath bleſſed us as thou ſeeſt very fairly, what canſt thou find in thy heart to give to him? what uſe ſhall we pay him for all that he hath lent unto us? ſhall we not give one or two out of a hundred that he hath added to our Eſtate? Shall men demand more of us, then we will give of our own good will unto our God? Shall not love engage us faſter then any other bands? Hath not God given unto us the principal, and requires nothing back again but a little ſmall pittance for his poor? Alas my ſoul, we are too much behind-hand with him already; and have run too far in arrears. For how many years have we lived in the world, and given nothing conſiderable unto his uſes? we are ſo much indebted that way, that we had need now to be more open-handed, and make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for our unjuſtice.</p>
                  <p>But then what ſhall we give him for himſelf and for his Son, if we be ſo much bound unto him for theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:31853:138"/>things? O my ſoul, once more conſider what gift we ſhall preſent our Lord withall? Are not thy firſt thoughts below the proportion of his love? Is it not too little that thou haſt conſecrated to his ſervice? Come my Soul, and open thy heart; it is to a good friend, even unto thy God; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtand upon it, but double the ſumme, and for every peny thou firſt thought of, write down two, for God hath proſpered us beyond all our thoughts. Or if we have not thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, perhaps it is becauſe we gave no more. Let us try therefore this way of thriving, by offering liberally unto God, and ſee how he will improve our goods for us. And I wiſh heartily that men would try, not onely for their ſouls ſake, but for the good of their bodies, and the welfare that I wiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their poſterities. For there is no ſuch ſure way of enlarging or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an eſtate, as doing good with it, and giving out of it to thoſe that need. By this means we do not ſo much leave God in truſt for our children, as make him become their debtor, who will pay them back again with large uſe and advantage.</p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:31853:138"/>
                  <p>I would not have writ ſo many lines of this ſubject, if I did not fear that mens Charity comes from them by drops, and thoſe drops likewiſe are expreſſed by accident and chance, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by any adviſed thoughts; And therefore I deſire that this part of our Religion may be made more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and have a deeper foundation in our hearts, ſo that we ſhould ſtudy what ſum of money God may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect from us, to whom he hath given ſo much. Now a fitter time there cannot be to meditate of this, then before our approaches to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn remembrance of Gods bounty and liberality towards us.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. We are likewiſe to endeavour, <hi>that all the paſsions and affections of our ſouls may be quieted and ſtilled.</hi> We muſt take ſome pains with them, that they may be ſo mortified and deadned to the world, that then they may not be too quick and lively, and hinder our Meditations of heavenly things.</p>
                  <p>For this (as you have ſeen) is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual banquet, and the food gives no nouriſhment, but what we receive by meditation, by ſerious thoughts and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:31853:139"/>affections, which can find no place, but onely in ſtill and quiet ſouls. When the body feaſts, a great part of the good Cheer is pleaſant diſcourſe, and innocent mirth; and there is no welcome unleſs there be ſome noiſe. But the ſoul feaſts in ſilence; it eats its morſels in a deep and calm thought; its pleaſure is in conference with its ſelf and God; and all the ſound is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the voice of thankſgiving in hymns or Pſalms of Praiſes to God, into which at laſt it breaks and utters its ſelf. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. Doſt not thou know (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) that thy ſoul ought to be big with a calm at that ſeaſon, when thou goeſt ſo near unto God? There is need of a great deal of peace and tranquility, and there ſhould be no tumults of anger, and ſuch like paſſions, ſince thou thinkeſt of the God of Love. The Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhines ſo hot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, that thou ſhouldeſt be as ſmooth and fair, as the face of the water in the brighteſt day. Thou ſhouldeſt labour that there may not be a wrinkle upon thy brow, that all thy
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:31853:139"/>ſtorms may be ſo huſht and lay'd, as if thou heard'ſt thy Saviours voice, ſaying, <hi>Peace, be ſtill.</hi> And therefore all holy men have taken an eſpecial care, when they were going to the Table of the Lord, to renew their acts of forgiveneſs, and paſſing by all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and offences, to reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perfectly to their Brethren, and repair any wrong that they could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conceive themſelves to have done to others, which before they had not obſerved. I have in the beginning of this Diſcourſe prevented all miſtakes, ſo that none can reaſonably think that he may harbour malice in his heart, and bear a grudge in his mind unto his neighbour, with ſufficient ſafety at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, ſo he do but diſcharge all theſe black paſſions when he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es unto God. And my meaning now is, That ſeeing we come to this Feaſt, that we may more encreaſe our love, we ought to ſearch if there be but any ſpark of anger that lies buried in our ſouls, and take care that it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly quenched. And ſeeing there will be many occaſions of differences among Neighbours, that we ought
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:31853:140"/>now to conſider if there were any heats in the management of them, and if any ſeeds of fire yet remain, that they may utterly be extinguiſhed, and never break forth again.<note place="margin">

Do you not feel the power of his death afar off? Do not his pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſides ſtrike to your heart before you behold them? Oh you bloody things! What have you done? What wounds have you made in the body of my Lord? Do not think to live any longer, oh you bloody things. Nay, never ſtruggle, nor reſiſt; for I have vowed you in ſacrifice unto him. Lay therefore your necks quietly upon the block, and prepare your ſelves for death which is approaching. Ask your evil hearts if they be not affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Wonder that they ſhould hold up their faces: Tell them that theſe are but the Addreſſes to their Execution; and proteſt folemnly, That none of theſe vile deſires ſhall live a day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and then they will begin to grow
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:31853:141"/>pale, ſick and languiſhing, before you come to the Altar, and there the ſlaughter will be more eaſie. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſay to thy ſelf, O my ſoul, wipe out the remembrance of all offences that any have done unto thee; let not one tittle of them remain, but be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. Thy fellow-ſervant hath affronted and contemned thee, but thou haſt oftner contemned thy God, thy Lord and Maſter himſelf.<note place="margin">V. Ch yſoft. Orat. <hi>60.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and what equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is there between a fellow-ſervant and thy Maſter? Perhaps he hath been inſolent towards thee once or twice, when he was provoked or wronged by thee; and thou behaveſt thy ſelf baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards thy Lord every day, though he be ſo far from wronging thee, that he is thy continual benefactor. O my ſoul, do but collect with thy ſelf how oft thou offendeſt in one day, yea but in one duty. What ſloth is there in thy Prayers? With what ſtrange ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence and diſregard doſt thou ſtand before God when thou ſpeakeſt to him? Never did a ſervant ſpeak ſo careleſly to his Maſter, nor a Souldier to his Commander. Yea, when thou
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:31853:142"/>ſpeakeſt to a friend, thou mindeſt what thou ſayeſt; but when thou art treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Lord about ſo many ſins, and art begging of him pardon and forgiveneſs, thou art too often like a man aſleep; and though thy knees be upon the ground, yet thy mind is in the Market, or in the Fields, and thy tongue blatters thou knoweſt not what. Away then all you angry thoughts, ſtay not to aggravate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. Be gone as clearly out of my heart, as I deſire my Lord to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my ſins no more. If we could bring our hearts thus bleeding to his holy Table; if the execution were begun before we came to him; then would our anger and malice, our love of pleaſures and all other worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, receive a deadly and incurable wound from our Saviours hand when we did receive him.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. As a moſt neceſſary Inſtrument to all theſe, the Apoſtle directs us <hi>to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelves.</hi> This is indeed a daily duty, but now ſhould be adverted with a greater intention and ardency of affection, when we are about theſe ſacred things. We ſhould examine
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:31853:142"/>our ſelves even about our neglects in the review of our ſelves, about the coldneſs of our prayers, the ſmallneſs of our ſorrows, the weakneſs of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and our daily unavoidable infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. We ſhould make more deep reflections into our ſelves, now that we are at more leiſure, and have ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned more time from other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; we ſhould open a greater vent for our tears, and cut a larger paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for our ſorrow, and affect our heart more deeply with our needs, and the certainty of ſupply; and ſo raiſe our ſouls to a greater height of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of deſire, and of confidence altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our Saviour ſeems to intimate, that before our approaches to God in any holy duty, it is a fit and proper time to call our ſelves to an account for the treſpaſſes we are guilty of, when he ſaith, Mat. 5.23, 24. <hi>If therefore thou bring the gift to the Altar, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thy Brother,</hi> &amp;c. It ſhould ſeem by this expreſſion that this is a ſeaſon of remembring and calling things to mind that are paſt and gone, which muſt be done by an examination of our ſelves. And you may conſider
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:31853:143"/>thus much to quicken you to this duty, that the better we know our ſelves and our own wants, the more hungry we ſhall be; and the more knowledge we have of our own ſincerity, with the greater comfort and ſweetneſs ſhall we eat. Now we know both the one and the other by ſelf-examination. For this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we render <hi>examine,</hi> hath two meanings, which are to <hi>prove</hi> and try, and to <hi>approve</hi> after trial.</p>
                  <p>So that in brief I may thus ſtate the whole buſineſs of examination.</p>
                  <p>We are to uſe an every-day-over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight over our ſelves. And this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and daily examination, is nothing elſe but ſuch a caution and diligence in all our actions, through the whole frame of our life, that our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may approve them upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; as accordant with the will of God. Or more briefly, it is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian care, to do every thing ſo, that God and our own Conſcience may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it. And it muſt needs conſiſt of two parts, Firſt, A Conſideration of what is our duty to do; of what is lawfull, and what unlawfull, of what
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:31853:143"/>is expedient, and what inconvenient;<note place="margin">

                        </gap>, what art thou, and whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou? or as the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſe to do, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſhew me your ticket, let me ſee your Paſs, that I may know you are a friend, <hi>Arrian.</hi> L. 3. cap. 12.</note> or an information of our ſelves, upon due advice and ſearch what is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon us as our duty, through our whole life. Then ſecondly, This fore-handed examination, muſt be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a ſerious conſideration of what we have done, and whether we behave our ſelves according to the Rule which we have laid down to our ſelves, as the guide of our life. From theſe two ariſe the whole of that, which is neceſſary to be done continually, for the approbation of our ſelves, to be ſuch perſons as have a care to pleaſe God. Now this may be the prime and firſt ſenſe of the Apoſtles words, when he ſaith, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. let him have a care that he lead ſuch a Chriſtian life, that his own heart may approve of him as one of Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. This you may be beſt ſatisfied out of another place where this word is uſed, Gal. 6.4. <hi>Let a man prove</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) or <hi>examine his own work,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning of which is, Let every man make his work ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and behave himſelf in that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:31853:144"/>manner, that both God and his own Conſcience may judge it to be right, and according to the Word of God. That this is the ſenſe of the phraſe in that place, will appear from the whole context, where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of bearing the infirmities of the weak, and not thinking our ſelves to be godly, becauſe we do not fall like them, by any temptation. And ſo ſaith he, Thou ſhalt <hi>have glory or rejoycing,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>toward thy ſelf, and not in regard of another,</hi> i. e. thou ſhalt take comfort ſimply in thy ſelf, that thou art a good man; and not only be pleaſed with comparing thy ſelf with others, and being better then they; for ſo thou mayeſt be, and yet not be good. From this it appears, that he ſpeaks not of ſomething that ſhould follow the actions of our life, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſearching whether they be good or no; but of ſuch an inſtitution and ordering of our lives beforehand, that we may not fall into thoſe ſins which we reprehend in another, nor be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to their ſins to make us ſeem godly.</p>
                  <p>And the next words, <hi>v.</hi> 5. plead for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:31853:144"/>this ſenſe: <hi>For every man ſhall bear his own burden,</hi> i. e. Thou oughteſt to make thy work good and approved, for every man ſins at his own peril. One mans ſin will not excuſe thee who doſt not ſin in that faſhion, but thou art to do thy own duty heartily to God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Conſcience, or elſe thou ſhalt ſuffer as well as he.</p>
                  <p>And that the Apoſtle may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto this examination, before we come to the Sacrament; in that place before-mentioned, there is another phraſe following, <hi>v.</hi> 31. which may perſwade us, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>For if we judge our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> if we do diſcern our ſelves, and diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate our actions, and determine our duty, and live in conformity to it, we ſhould not be judged nor puniſhed of God in this ſort. But whether this be the proper meaning of <hi>examining</hi> or no, I ſhall not be overmuch ſolicitous, ſeeing I have already made this good, that he muſt be a holy perſon that comes to Gods Table.</p>
                  <p>And that there is beſide this, a more particular examination to be uſed, when the time is near of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:31853:145"/>with our Lord, I willingly grant. And it conſiſts of two parts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the two-fold uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we render <hi>examine.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> is a proof, trial and ſearch into our own ſouls, that we may know our eſtate, and in what condition we ſtand before God. So the word is uſed, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.21. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>prove all things,</hi> i. e. make a trial of them, and conſider what they are, and then hold faſt that which you find to be good. This examination (conſidering that I ſuppoſe a pious life to precede) muſt chiefly conſiſt in a review of thoſe failings, or of thoſe wants which our every-day proof of our ſelves doth preſent us withall. If we ſhould never examine our ſelves but when we come to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we ſhould not know what we are, nor what we need, but in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed heap of things many would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved; and yet if we ſhould not alſo examine then, we ſhould not have ſuch a lively ſenſe of what we are to ask, and for what we ought to plead the bloud of Chriſt: But then this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is but a ſerious reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:31853:145"/>the Notes which we take every day of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Unleſs it be needfull that we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves, whether we have not forgot any of the ends for which we go to the Table of the Lord; and though that be a great part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles meaning, yet I have already taken notice of it. In ſhort, we are to ſearch rather in what ſtate our Graces ſtands, than whether we be in a ſtate of Grace or no.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly, We muſt <hi>approve</hi> and allow of our ſelves, and bring the trial to ſuch an iſſue, that we paſs a verdict on our ſouls. So the word is uſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.18. thou <hi>approveſt,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>the things that are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> i. e. Thou profeſſeſt to like and embrace them. And ſo when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle bids the Children of the light <hi>to prove what is acceptable unto God,</hi> Epheſ. 5.8, 10. He doth not mean a bare inquiſition, but that act which follows it, which is embracing. For they cannot be deemed Children of the light, who do not ſo enquire after the pleaſure of God, as to purſue and practiſe it.</p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:31853:146"/>
                  <p>The meaning likewiſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22. is this: Happy is he, that when he uſes an indifferent thing, doth approve himſelf, as doing that which is lawfull, and acts not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſcience. Or this, Happy is he, that when he is reſolved that he may do ſuch a thing lawfully, and with the approbation of his Conſcience, yet doth it with ſuch a care, that he hurts not others by the uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>There is one place more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. where you have both theſe parts of examination together, <hi>Try your ſelves, whether you be in the faith, prove,</hi> (i. e. <hi>approve</hi>) <hi>your ſelves.</hi> When you know your eſtate by trial, then paſs a judgement upon your ſelves, to be what you profeſs and pretend unto. Now all the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a good man is to give of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before he go to the Lords Supper, is this; 1. He ought to judge himſelf, to continue a friend of Chriſt, and to remain (as far as he can find) in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God. And 2. He ought to find that he hath uſed ſome godly care and diligence, that he come not in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:31853:146"/>a rude, unbeſeeming, and drowſie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, into ſo holy a preſence. And this is plainly another part of the Apoſtles meaning, when he ſaith, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo eat,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. Let him approve himſelf to come for pious and holy ends, and with a due regard to the Lords moſt ſacred body and blood.</p>
                  <p>Lay thy hand then (Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) upon thy heart, before thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to this Table, and feel how the pulſe of thy ſoul beats: mind whether it beat evenly, or after a diſtempered ſort. Doth it move three times as quick, when thou thinkeſt of the World, as it doth when God is in thy heart? When art thou all in a heat? When thou art in purſuit of the World, or when thou followeſt after God? Ask thy heart, whom doſt thou love moſt? What is it that thou doſt moſt conſtantly deſire? In what Company is it thy pleaſure to be? Doſt thou love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy mind, and all thy ſtrength? Hadſt thou rather dye than diſpleaſe him? Are thy graces not only alive, but lively? Come then,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:31853:147"/>let us go to this holy Feaſt, and thank the Lord for this Grace, and for all his other favours.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. If we find by examining, that we have fallen into any ſin, and through neglect or ignorance broken our reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſince the laſt Communion; <hi>Let us make moſt ſerious reflections upon it.</hi> Beſides all the ſorrow that I muſt ſuppoſe it hath coſt a good heart, preſently after its commiſſion, beſides its hatred of it, and affliction of it ſelf for it, with a moſt ſpeedy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fault: This is a fit time to bewail it over again, to call our ſelves to a new account for it, to drown it in another flood of tears, more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtrengthen our reſolutions againſt it, and to prepare it for to receive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wound, a mortal ſtroak from the wounds of Jeſus, that it may never live any more. Say therefore thus to thy ſelf, when thou art in thy meditations, What didſt thou mean, O my ſoul, to be ſo treacherous unto God, and to break thy reſolution? Was there ever a better Maſter? Were ever any tyed to another by ſuch ſacred Bands and Oaths? O perjured wretch that thou
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:31853:147"/>art! What was in thy heart to break looſe from God? doſt thou not bluſh to think of it? or rather art thou not pale and wan, and ready to dye, to think of ſuch a horrid thing? Well, I ſee theſe ſins are not quite dead, but ſtill they ſtirre and move; or though they ſeem to be ſtretched out, and to have no life, yet they may recover. But I am reſolved, if Chriſt can kill them, that they ſhall not live. Come along with me (if you dare live ſo long) into his preſence, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your mortal wound from his hand, ſeeing you will not be killed by mine. There ſhall you all be ſlain at his feet, you ſhall be nailed to his Croſs, and I will leave you hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, till you be aſham'd to live.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. But if the commiſſion of ſuch a ſin have brought any timerouſneſs (as well it may) upon the heart, ſo that it trembles to ſet one foot forward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lords Table, and its hands ſhake with a paralitick fear, ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtretch them to receive ſuch Pledges of Gods Love; <hi>It is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that a man adviſe with his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:31853:148"/>Paſtor and Director in the way of life.</hi> I wiſh it were better underſtood, for what ends God hath ſet Paſtors o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the flock; and that men would look upon them as a kind of Parents, to whom they ſhould go in all their needs: But now the ſubject of my Diſcourſe leads me to ſay no more but this, That there are two neceſſary times of receiving the benefit of their counſell. The one is, when a mans ſin oppreſſeth him ſo ſorely with the ſenſe of the guilt it hath contracted, that he can receive no <hi>comfort.</hi> And the other is, when it oppreſſeth him ſo heavily with its ſtrength and power, that he can get no <hi>conqueſt</hi> over it. There is a third ſeaſon when it is at leaſt convenient to repair unto them; and that is, when a man is in doubt whether he have paſſed a right judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon himſelf, which ſhould make him deſirous to have the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe perſons, that can neither be deemed to be deceived themſelves through ignorance, nor to be willing to deceive others through flattery and partial Judgement. If any one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be in the perplexity of ſuch like
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:31853:148"/>caſes, when he thinks of coming to this holy feaſt, let him diſ-imboſome his ſoul unto him that hath the care of it, and deſire him, that out of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der love a Father ought to have unto his Child, he would be his guide in this Affair. And ſo ſhall a man know how to uſe theſe ſpiritual weapons better, when he is taught by a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Commander; and the more ſolid comfort ſhall he have, when his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician aſſures him that (as far as he can diſcern) he is in a ſtate of health.</p>
                  <p>X. And yet when we have done all this, then we ſhould pray <hi>to God that he would prepare us better than all our preparation.</hi> As when a King comes unto a City to ſtay there for ſome ſpace, he doth not expect that the Citizens (if they be poor) ſhould provide all the furniture for him, which is a thing above their power; but he ſends the Grooms of his Chamber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with ſuch Hangings and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as may make the houſe they have prepared, moſt befitting his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. So let us entreat the Lord, that after all our endeavour to ſet apart our hearts for him, to ſweep the houſe as
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:31853:149"/>clean as we can, and fit it to receive ſuch a glorious Gueſt; he would be pleaſed to ſend his holy Spirit, that may prepare the place for him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn our ſouls with ſuch Graces, that His Sacred Majeſty may not diſdain to come and make his abode with us. Say thus unto thy gracious God: Oh Lord! thou ſeeſt how much dirt I have left behind after all my diligence, to cleanſe and purifie my ſoul. Alas! all my thoughts of thee are but dreams; all my deſires but a vapour; my Love is but a flaſh; my Prayers are but a breath; my Tears will ſcarce fill a bubble; and my Sorrow is no bigger than a Sigh; all that I do, I am aſhamed of it my ſelf, and therefore thou maiſt much more loath it, and deſpiſe it. Come thou,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139 23, 24.</note> O Lord, therefore, <hi>and ſearch my heart; try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> Do thou awaken in me moſt lively thoughts; do thou inkindle a burning affection; open thou the flood-gates of my eyes; and open thou my lips, that my mouth may ſhew orth thy praiſe. Seeing my heart
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:31853:149"/>(Lord!) is ſo ſtrait and narrow, that it is not fit to entertain thee, do thou widen and enlarge it, and then come and fill me with thy ſelf, and ſay, <hi>Here will I dwell, for I have deſired it; this is my reſt for ever.</hi> Yea, O my graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, unleſs thou interpoſe thy Power, I am very much afraid I ſhall not keep this little goodneſs till the next morning, which now ſeems to be in me. Theſe weak Thoughts, theſe faint Deſires and ſickly Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in my ſoul, I doubt will not live a night, unleſs thou find wayes for to preſerve and cheriſh them; my inveterate habits of evil will ſmother and choak theſe new Reſolutions. I am in fear that all theſe meditations will be flown away while I am aſleep, and my houſe will be foul again before I awake, unleſs thou keep me. Ah my dear God! ſeeing I have beſtowed ſome ſmall pains upon my heart, and have conceived ſome little hopes, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them not to be all daſhed in pieces in a night! Spread the wings of thy goodneſs over me, and maintain that which not I, but thou thy ſelf haſt wrought. Lord! let me find when I
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:31853:150"/>awake, that my affections and deſires are grown beyond the ſtrength of man, and that thy power reſts up on me. Oh let me find a greater fervour than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in thy ſervice; let that ſpark which I feared would go out, be grown to a flame that will never expire; and ſo ſhalt thou draw mine eyes towards thy ſelf alone, who workeſt ſuch wonders; ſo ſhall my heart be filled with nothing but thy ſweetneſs; and my lips ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow with thy praiſes. Lord! if I may beg this grace of thee, I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwaded I ſhall languiſh after none but thee, and ſeek for no other pleaſures but to pleaſe thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my good Lord! I leave my ſelf in thy hands, hoping that either I am or would be ſuch as thou wouldſt have me. And if I be arrived but as far as a will and deſire to be what thou wouldſt have me, <hi>that will is thine;</hi> and therefore ſeeing that will is mine too, and we both conſpire together, I take the boldneſs to ſay, <hi>Lord! let thy will be done.</hi> Oh my ſweet Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our! I was going to ſay that I am ſick of love, that I cannot live unleſs thou love me, and make me better. But I

                  <p>WHat preparation there ſhould be beſides this, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, it being directly contrary to the firſt thing that I propounded, for any to imagine that we ought juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament, to have a greater care of not ſinning, than at other times. We are alwayes pilgrims and ſtrangers, and ſo ought to abſtain from fleſhly luſts that warre againſt the ſoul. Theſe luſts are alwayes poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and not onely when we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take the Cup of the Lord into
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:31853:151"/>our hand. And therefore it is a grand deceit to think that we and our ſins muſt be ſevered only then, when we more nearly embrace our Lord; for holineſs is our profeſſion afterward, as much as before we communicate with his Holineſs. Or rather all the time <hi>after</hi> one Communion, being <hi>before</hi> the next which doth ſucceed, it is the time of Preparation for it. We are to keep our ſelves in a conſtant purity, and to labour to keep cloſe to the Covenant of our God; only when the time doth nearly approach, that we may enjoy ſuch another repaſt, we ſhould excite our appetite, raiſe our thoughts and meditations, imprint the ends of the inſtitution more fairly in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, voluntarily offer more of our time and our thoughts to religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and do all that over again with a greater zeal, which we have been doing every day ſince we were laſt in his Sacred Preſence. You may obſerve, that as juſt before this ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, our thoughts are more deep and ſerious, and our hearts lifted up to a greater fervour, and we have ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er longings after Chriſt and his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:31853:151"/>which prepare us for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo the enjoyment leaves us for ſome time afterward in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat, in more lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and more vigorous affections. But theſe through multitude of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and many occaſions, may languiſh by little and little, and may abate of that degree and ardour wherein they were, (which I look upon as the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rather than the ſin of a good heart) and therefore our work is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our ſouls before the next Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to the ſame, or rather an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of zeal. And then though afterward there may be again ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement and fall in our affections, yet it will be leſs; and more fervency and heat will remain, than would have been, if we had not got up our hearts by that Preparation, and that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to an higher pitch of ſpiritual love.</p>
                  <p>The Primitive Chriſtians who communicated every day (as ſome paſſages in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would make us think) or at leaſt every Lords Day, had need of leſs of this Preparation that I have mentioned;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:31853:152"/>for as ſoon as ever the flame began to decay, there was new fewel added; and that degree of warmth (to which they were raiſed) was ſcarce gone from their hearts, before a new fire was kindled. But now the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is ſo, that this Feaſt returns more ſeldome, and we cannot ſay with <hi>Baſil,</hi>

                     <hi>We Communicate four times in a week, beſides all Feſtival dayes,</hi> but it is very much if men be ſo devout as to Communicate <hi>once in four weeks;</hi> and therefore becauſe many things may be ſlipt out of our minds, and former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions may be grown weak, we had need more ſolemnly to recollect what we have learnt, to ſtir up our remembrance, to renew a ſenſe of the ends of its inſtitution, of our own wants, of the wants of the poor, and the reſt of thoſe things which I have in the former Chapter recommended to your thoughts.</p>
                  <p>If men underſtood theſe things, they would neither wonder that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtians communicated ſo oft, nor would they have any excuſe left for their own neglect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay they would not wonder
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:31853:152"/>that the fervour of thoſe primitive ſouls was ſo great, for they had a huge care to lead an holy life, and that made them both fit and deſirous to converſe with God every day. VVe judge of them perhaps by our ſelves, and think that it was ſuperſtition rather than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that made them ſo forward to this Office; and by caſting a blot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Piety, we hope in this frozen age to be accounted Pious. If ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition can be believed to have grown up ſo early, then we may be thought with leſs zeal to be more devout. If they did only flatter Chriſt with ſuch a buſie devotion and frequent reſort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; we may hope to paſs for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Friends, that are not ſo forward, but more diſcreetly reſerved and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our company. So handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do our deceitfull hearts teach us to cover our own nakedneſs, by calling all that ſuperſtition which creates any trouble to us, and crying out upon that as a ſpice of Will-Worſhip, which doth not ſort with our humour. For it too plainly appears, that if a Child of our own brain do pleaſe us well, we are as fond of it, as any of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:31853:153"/>can be thought to be of their conceptions, and would have the world embrace it as a divine Ordinance, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Heaven. The very truth is, <hi>Men lend to God, and their Devotion, only ſuch Offices as flatter their paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> There is much of pleaſure in having the ears tickled with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and it makes a great noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our Neighbours, to keep dayes of Faſting and Prayer; and therefore theſe are accepted with a greater ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, than the ſad Meditations of Chriſts death, and the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Wounds of a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour, which prick too deep, and make too wide gaſhes in our hearts. Though this be more expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded than many other things that men perform with a great noiſe, and ſpend much zealous breath upon; yet they caſt but a cold and heavy aſpect on it, becauſe it humours not their eaſe, and ſpeaks not kindly to their covetouſneſs, but makes too buſie and narrow a ſearch into their ſouls. And really I doubt that mens endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be removed as far as they can from <hi>Rome,</hi> have done our Religion a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:31853:153"/>great deal of harm. They ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the cuſtome of celebrating every day, but the Prieſt doth it alone, and they make it a Sacrifice for the quick and dead. Now ſome men, ſo that this falſe notion was deſtroyed, and private Maſſes aboliſhed, did not care though the frequent Communions were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed alſo together with them; and it is our manner to pay this honour to Chriſt but twice or thrice in a year. And ſo becauſe they ſpeak of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation differently from us, men are apt to live as though good works were a piece of Popery, and as if Alms-deeds and Charity to the Poor, were a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous thing in Religion. Though men Communicate very ſeldome, yet their Offerings are as ſparing as if they Communicated every week, and ſo their ſouls and the Poor, are both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded and ſtarved together. Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and covetouſneſs are mens dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; they are the brats of all new devices in Religion, and theſe two are nurſed up and dandled on the knees of this trifling conceit, that zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians do bear too great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to this Sacrament, and hope
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:31853:154"/>to go to Heaven by their charitable deeds. Well! let ſloth and avarice pride themſelves a while; it will not be long before God take down their Plumes, and make it manifeſt, that it was not ſuperſtition which prickt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the firſt Chriſtians to ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communion, nor vain-glory which made them ſo prodigal (as the modern ſtile is) in their liberality. Methinks I ſee how the lazy and worldly Chriſtians do thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Arms of Chriſt, and do even melt and diſſolve into his boſome in raptures of love; their mouthes can reliſh nothing but Chriſt, and his Name is ſo ſweet that it is ingraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their lips; they court him as if they would raviſh his heart, and they exceed the ſtrains of all Romantick lovers; If he will not beſtow himſelf upon them, they cannot imagine who ſhould be taken into his heart. They cannot believe but he will take it very ill if they will not truſt him for their ſalvation, without troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whom he is ſo tender of, that he would have them void of all care and thoughtfulneſs. It is a piece of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:31853:154"/>ſelf (think ſuch men) to be ſo ſtrict and curious; Alas poor ignorant ſouls! men would fain be doing ſomething to procure ſalvation; they would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Heaven, and give ſomething to attain it, but we will give Chriſt the honour of doing all, and only caſt our ſelves upon him, that he may ſave us. You cannot imagine now how theſe mens hearts are tickled and raviſhed with theſe Liquoriſh thoughts; and the pleaſure of them, doth but make them believe that they are in greater favour. In this tranſport of fancy they do veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive that they have the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the holy Ghoſt, bearing witneſs to them that they are the Sons of God. But how fearfully theſe perſons will one day fall, is a great deal further from all our conceits. The Lord will ſhake off all theſe men with a great deal of diſdain, who offer but to touch the very skirts of his Garments. O you vile and adulterous ſouls (will he ſay) who think that I am altogether ſuch an one as your ſelves, depart from me, for I know you not, ye work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity. Down you arrogant ſpirits that thought to build your neſts
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:31853:155"/>on high, and by the wings of fancy to flie up unto Heaven; I have no room in my heart for ſuch flatterers, nor can my foul love ſuch Hypocrites and Unbelievers. But come you bleſſed of my Father, (you who have loved me, and kept my Commandments, you that did what I bid you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,) and inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you. Then ſhall there be great wailing, and men ſhall groan for anguiſh of ſpirit. Then ſhall the <hi>worldlings</hi> ſay, this is he whom we had ſometimes in deriſion and a Proverb of reproach. We fools ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his life madneſs, and his end without honour. How is he numbred among the Children of God, and his lot is among the Saints? I wiſh all men would lay it to heart betimes, and not think that it is preciſeneſs to endeavour to obſerve all the commands of our bleſſed Lord. Which if we did, then this command would not be ſo ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of commemorating his death in the way he hath appointed, nor ſhould men be ſo unmeet for it as now they ſeem to be.</p>
                  <p>For Secondly; What excuſes can
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:31853:155"/>men find to palliate the neglect of this duty, but what ariſe from an unholy or careleſs life? Many pretences there are, I know, to keep me from waiting upon our Lord, and accepting of his kindneſs, but they all grow upon this bitter root of loving the world and the luſts of it. We put him off with the excuſe of too much boldneſs, and rudeneſs that we ſhould be guilty of, if we ſhould give him frequent viſits. Truly as the caſe ſtands, moſt men would be too full of confidence if they ſhould approach; but the only reaſon is, becauſe they have a mind to live as ſtrangers to him, and not to be his houſhold Servants and Domeſticks; for then they might alway come unto him. Men plead their unworthineſs, but it were well if they were more ſenſible of it, for then they would not remain ſo unworthy. They think they muſt not come ſo oft, becauſe it coſts them ſo much time to prepare themſelves once; but if they would ſpare ſo much time as to lead an holy life, and be at ſo much trouble as to pleaſe God in other things, they would not find it ſo labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to pleaſe him well in this. If they
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:31853:156"/>did alwayes keep a fear of God in their ſouls, then they would without much pain be fit to approach with fear and reverence into his preſence. One ſaith he is incumbred with buſineſs, and hath not time to prepare himſelf; another hath differences with his Neighbour, and is not reconciled; a third intends it very ſhortly, but for ſome reaſons muſt at preſent omit it. None of theſe men fear to live in the known ſins of worldlineſs, enmity, delayes, and yet fear to do a known duty which our Lord a little before he died, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us. If theſe perſons would but fear to do that which God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, then they would not fear to do that which God hath commanded. But while they refuſe to obey him in one thing, it is not to be expected that they ſhould yield ſubjection in another. Nay, the world ſhall do more with them, than God can do, while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſuch ſtrangers to him. For if there were a reward of an hundred pounds annexed by ſome Benefactor to every Receiving; this golden rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon no man would be able to reſiſt, but all buſineſs would be thrown aſide
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:31853:156"/>upon ſo rich an account. So baſe and deceitfull are the hearts of men, that they pretend fear of diſpleaſing God, when it is but a fear of being engaged too ſtrictly for to pleaſe him. They ſay this is the moſt excellent food, but they are loath to taſte it, becauſe they would not be at the pains to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a ſtomack to it, and digeſt it.</p>
                  <p>They keep it for a good bit at laſt, till ſickneſs make them hungry, and will give them no leave to ſin after it. They look upon it as a ſtrong Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that muſt be uſed only in deſperate caſes, when ſoul and body are parting and taking their leave of each other. But if it have ſuch a power to make men happy, then why could it not make them holy? and why did they not uſe it all their life long to that purpoſe, but becauſe they had no love to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Therefore as <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> ſaid to the Prieſt of <hi>Orpheus</hi> his myſteries, who perſwaded him to be initiated in his Religion, becauſe all ſuch ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive eternal felicities; <hi>Why then doſt thou not dye, man? if thou believeſt ſo, why loveſt thou this life ſo well thy ſelf?</hi> So ſay I to theſe men, if there be ſuch
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:31853:157"/>vertue in the Sacrament to carry you to Heaven, ſo that you would receive it when you die; Why do you not uſe it that it may carry you thither while you live? why would you not be in Heaven now, if you think it ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable thing? and why do not you va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue that which you account a means to bring you thither?</p>
                  <p>And as for godly people who are afraid to come, becauſe they find not themſelves ſo prepared as they would be; they had beſt take heed leſt they turn truly <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> by fearing more than needs. Do you make it the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of your lives to pleaſe God? do you daily live upon the Lord Jeſus, and feed on him in your hearts by a lively faith? is he before your eyes as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector and example of all your actions? Why ſhould you think then that he will not be pleaſed with your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at his Table? Would you have a thought as ſtrong as an Angel? would you be able to flie as ſwiftly as a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim, and love with ſuch a flame as a Seraphim? And will you ſtay till you be as richly adorned as a glorified Saint, before you think it be fit to attend on
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:31853:157"/>him? Methinks it ſhould be ſome comfort to a good heart that it hath ſuch enlarged and noble deſires. But if it may not feaſt with God till it have what it would, why do not men trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pray without ſuch perfections? why do they not dread to hear and read the Word of God; and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their faces when they look up to Heaven in any Meditations? Are theſe ſuch trifling duties? or do not theſe conſtitute the prime and vital parts of this which they ſo dread? Doth not the ſoul feed it ſelf at the Sacrament by holy Prayers, affectionate thoughts, devout thankſgivings, and a hearty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it ſelf to God? I doubt while we cry out juſtly againſt the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rome,</hi> many of us have that too near our very hearts, which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry root and life of all ſuperſtition. For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> is a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs trembling ariſing out of our own mind, when there is nothing in the object on which we look to breed ſuch an affrightment. If we make this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>terrible myſtery,</hi> that we dare not do the duty which Chriſt hath commanded us, then
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:31853:158"/>it is plain our minds are filled with Heatheniſh terrors, and we affright our ſouls with our own childiſh imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Take heed therefore of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be that would make you run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from your duty, and do not <hi>breed</hi> up your ſouls in ſuch a dread of your Father, that you <hi>ſhould turn reverence into horror, fear into affrightment, and the cup of gladneſs into the Wine of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> Why ſhould you turn your backs when God invites you to him? why ſhould you feed on ſcruples, when you may feed on the bread of life? why ſhould you go and weep alone, when God would have you to rejoyce with your Brethren? I can imagine no reaſon of it but this, that ſome have little care to live godlily; and thoſe that have, underſtand not well the terms of the Goſpel; and one reaſon why many underſtand them no better, is, becauſe this duty is performed ſo ſeldome wherein they ſhould renew their Covenant with God. Men have but little acquaintance with this thing, and that makes them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of it; and they ſeldome come to God in this manner, and that makes
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:31853:158"/>them more fearfull when they have a mind to come. If this Feaſt ſhould be kept every day, it might be apt to grow into contempt; but now being rarely obſerved, it breeds in our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and weak natures a ſtrange and panick fear. And therefore the beſt advice that I know of to be given to all good people, is this; 1. <hi>That they throughly underſtand what the ends are for which this remembrance of Chriſt is appointed:</hi> And, 2. <hi>That they believe the chiefeſt preparation to it is a holy life.</hi>

                  <p>BUt ſome perhaps will ſay, that I have only directed thoſe that are already in a ſtate of grace, and it may be asked, whether there be not another ſort of preparation for thoſe that are not yet entred upon Religion, and what qualifications will diſpoſe men for their firſt Communion with the People of God.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That ſuppoſing they are Baptized, and have been Catechized and inſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith, the duty of ſuch Perſons is,</p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:31853:159"/>
                  <p>Firſt, To own and profeſs their Baptiſmal Covenant now that they are attained to years of diſcretion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Let them <hi>own</hi> it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their own ſoul, and let them <hi>profeſs</hi> it unto him that God hath ſet over them, and ſo deſire to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for to ſtrengthen their reſolution, by adding <hi>a new Sacrament</hi> to the former Engagement. That which they ſhould have done at Baptiſm, if they had been men, let them do now that they underſtand their Baptiſm, and enter their proteſtations againſt the luſts of the world, the fleſh, and the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As they muſt well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves before they make ſuch a profeſſion, ſo now intending to receive this holy Sacrament, they ſhould make a new ſearch into all the parts of their ſoul. Let ſuch a man therefore <hi>firſt</hi> bring his underſtanding unto tryal, and examine it what it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends concerning Chriſt and all his Offices. What knowledge it hath of the ends of his death, and the benefits that come thereby unto us, as alſo of the nature of the new Covenant, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:31853:159"/>of this Sacrament whereby we come to partake of thoſe benefits. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Call thy <hi>Judgement</hi> before the Barr of Conſcience, and ask it how it prizes and eſteems of Chriſt and all his benefits, and whether it count all things but dung and droſs for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his knowledge, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it value the deliverance wrought by him, from the power as well as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin, more than a Kingdom bigger than the world.</p>
                  <p>Then thirdly, Take thy <hi>will</hi> under examination, and ask it if it heartily conſent to believe all that he ſaith, to do all that he commands, and to expect in ſuch a way all that he promiſeth. Here thou muſt be very inquiſitive, leſt thy heart ſhould be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Maſters. And it is neceſſary that thou repreſent unto thy ſelf all the dangers thou mayeſt undergo, and the hazards thou mayeſt run, if thou cleave to Chriſt, and not unto the world; and then ask thy ſoul if it chuſe Chriſt with diſgrace, if it embrace him and a ſtake both together; and in one word, <hi>if it ſincerely love a crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:31853:160"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Then next of all, Let thy affections be called to an account, which are but ſeveral motions of thy will. See what ſorrow, what pain and grief thou haſt conceived for offending of thy Lord. What hunger and thirſt there is in thee after righteouſneſs. What deſire after the Blood of Chriſt, to quench the fire of Gods anger that is kindled in thy ſoul, and to waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all that filthineſs which makes him angry. See that thou be in love, in charity with all men, that there be no hatred nor enmity, no wrath nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt any of thy Brethren. See that there be ſuch affections in thy heart as befit that duty which thou thinkeſt to perform, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> Ask thy ſoul, why did thy Saviour bleed? was he a Malefactor? or were thy ſins the Traytors which delivered him to theſe horrid torments? What hatred then doſt thou find againſt them? how canſt thou find in thy heart to uſe them. Ask again, Was thy Saviour overcome by death, or did he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it? O think what triumph it ſhould raiſe in thy ſoul (if thou doſt conſent unto him) and what joy it
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:31853:160"/>ſhould create in thy heart, that he hath deſtroyed ſin, death, and the grave, and opened the gates of life. Ask it once more, What are thoſe glorious things that he hath purchaſed by his Bloud? And what love doſt thou feel in thy ſelf towards him? What ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy haſt thou with his dear affection? and what canſt thou find in thy heart to do for the Holy Jeſus?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, And then after all this, let all the actions of thy life be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before the ſame Tribunal, and arraign thy ſelf for all the villanies thou haſt committed againſt thy Lord, for all the breaches of thy faith and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oath unto him. Yea, if there be but a little paſſion, a raſh word, a vain thought, whereby thou haſt given him the leaſt prick of a wound, find them out as near as thou canſt, and let them be brought forth to be ſlain before him.</p>
                  <p>Then laſtly, Dive moſt ſeriouſly into the bottome of thy heart, and fetch up all the <hi>reſolutions</hi> that thou thinkeſt lye there, ſet them in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry face of thy Lord, and ask thy heart before him, and bid it ſay true, as it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:31853:161"/>will anſwer it at the day of Judgement, What are thy purpoſes for the future? for what <hi>ends</hi> wouldſt thou approach to the Lords Table? Yea, go ſo far as to examine thy ſelf about thy <hi>intention</hi> in ſuch things as thou thought'ſt former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could never be done, or never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided from being done. Ask thy heart about the faults of thy nature, of thy temper, and thoſe which through humane weakneſs will occurre; about thy fooliſh thoughts; thy little paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which none diſcern to ſwell but thy ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Art thou reſolved to be more watchfull againſt theſe, to uſe more induſtry to ſuppreſs them, to redeem thy time, to avoid all occaſions of evil, to guard thy ſelf more ſtrongly where the temptation uſed to come? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve thy ſelf, and be ſatisfied about all theſe particulars, and ſo accordingly proceed forward when thou knoweſt thy ſelf, and thy heart hath told the truth concerning thine eſtate. For examination is not commanded for it ſelf, but in order to ſomething elſe that is to follow after this ſearch.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore thirdly, Let every man approve himſelf in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:31853:161"/>and judge that he is a perſon that means really to live godlily, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all other Maſters, and cleave to Jeſus only, having an underſtanding of the conditions of his Service. Let thy ſoul give thee a good Anſwer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foregoing examination, and then I have little more to ſay. But be ſure of this, That thy judgement of thy ſelf (<hi>i. e.</hi> of thy Underſtanding, Will, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) be impartial and unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed, and do not incline to any favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conſtruction of thy ſelf, but let the Word of God be thy Rule, and thy ſpiritual Paſtor be thy Guide, if thou doubteſt that thou flattereſt thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But fourthly, If thou haſt lately committed ſome great and ſcandalous offence, before thy heart began to be thus pricked and ſtimulated to ranſack it ſelf, <hi>make ſome trial of thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou comeſt to the Lords Table.</hi> Two ſorts of Converts there are. Some have not behaved themſelves towards God as they ought, but lived careleſly without the exerciſe of Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to him; yet have not committed any groſs ſin, which might caſt a blot
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:31853:162"/>upon the Sacredneſs of this Feaſt, if they ſhould preſently come to it, nor offend the flock of Chriſt who have Communion with them. If they be touched with a ſenſe of their private neglect, if their ſins againſt God be a burden to them, though men know them not, if they heartily abhor them, and betake themſelves to the work of godlineſs with all their might, and do firmly determine with themſelves, that they will hereafter be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent in their duty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to come to the Sacrament, that they may be more ſtrongly engaged and tyed to do as they reſolve, I think they may have a comfortable hope that there is a change wrought in them, and ſo ſhould approach unto it.</p>
                  <p>But there are others whoſe ſins are notorious and ill favoured, known to all the Neighbourhood. And perhaps they have been reeking in a ſin a few dayes before the holy Communion, but their hearts begin now to ſmite them, and they find ſuch ſevere reproofs in their ſouls, that prick them to ſome good reſolutions. I would wiſh theſe perſons ſeriouſly to adviſe with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:31853:162"/>whether this may not be a <hi>ſtart</hi> which comes from ſome ſudden ſpurre; and to make trial how they can like to travell in the wayes of God. There are certain pangs of devotion that come upon men againſt a ſolemn time, and when their ſouls are at a little leiſure, they ſpeak very freely to them, and their ſins being great, ugly and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they may much affright them: Therefore it is the ſafeſt courſe to ſtay till this fit be over, and the next day to look upon them with the eye of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conſideration, and ſee whether they have not recovered their old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and begin to ſmile again. For elſe we may adde one ſin to another, if we come to this holy duty with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of our ſins, and a likelihood to return again unto them, after ſome little falling out which may conclude in a greater kindneſs. It is monſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unſeemly and dangerous for a man to come from the laſt dayes vomit, and his yeſternight ſurfeit to ſit at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord, though he ſeem never ſo much aſhamed. It is that which deſtroyes Religion, for men to think, that they can leap ſo inſtantly from one
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:31853:163"/>ſtate to another, and change a ſtate of fin for a ſtate of Grace, at a dayes warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Such Crimes muſt be purged with a great ſorrow, and in a deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; which if it be true, will make a man think himſelf unworthy to be preſently entertained by God in ſo near a Communion, yea to be below the leaſt good look from his gracious eye. With many tears will ſuch a man ſeek but for the hope of a pardon; many puniſhments will he inflict upon himſelf for ſuch intemperance, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, or covetouſneſs, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever other groſs ſin it be that he is guilty of, and he will think it but a juſt puniſhment, that though he were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he ſhould keep himſelf from the enjoying of God at his Table, and from ſuch good company of Gods People. Shall I who am a Beaſt (will ſuch an one ſay) go among the People of Gods Paſture? A meer Wolf go and feed among the Sheep of his hands? I who have wallowed in vice, like a Swine in the mire, go and ſit me down in ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a place? I whoſe meat hath been ordure and filth, to put the Bread of God to my lips? Far be it from me;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:31853:163"/>let me rather eat aſhes, the bread of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and take my tears for my drink. No! let my tongue rather cleave to the roof of my mouth; let my lips rather be ſowed together, than that I ſhould preſume to drink of the Cup of Bleſſing, who have deſerved ſuch a curſe from the hand of God. I ſit down with God at his Table! A Dunghill is a more proper place for ſuch a bruit. Come, let us embrace the duſt, let us kiſs the earth, and think it is a ſtrange mercy that we live; and let us ſtay a while to ſee if the Lord will let us live and hope to live for ever. Sit at the Table of the Lord! Alas! I am not fit to lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my own bed. I dare not ſleep, for fear I die. And oh! that I could give no reſt to my eyes, nor ſlumber to my eye-lids, till I had prepared a place for him to dwell in. Oh that we were but friends, though he would not uſe me as his friend.</p>
                  <p>I have but repreſented to you the ſad and pathetick groans of a heart, that knows what it is to ſin. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to move forward ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, as men are apt to do; it
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:31853:164"/>ſtands ſtill, or rather it lyes down, and knows not what to do. It won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at the ſecurity and careleſneſs of offenders; and if ſleep come to ſtroak its head with the hopes of a ſlumber, it can ſcarce tell how to welcome it, by receiving its kindneſs, and ſuffering its blanditions. But then all this ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tends to joy; and is but like the Clouds which gather about the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which having wept as much as they can, make them look the clearer. This humility and modeſty doth not make a ſoul run from God, but makes him to approach to it. And when a man perceives really that he hath left his ſin, and is become a new Creature, then let him entreat the favour of God, that he who hath done him ſo much good, would grant him the liberty to be in the number of thoſe whom he feeds at his own Table.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When thou findeſt that it is the ſincere reſolution, and likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of thy ſoul to pleaſe God, <hi>though in ſome things thou ſhouldſt break thy reſolution againſt the very purpoſe of thy heart; yet let not this hinder thy coming to the Supper of the Lord.</hi>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:31853:164"/>When notwithſtanding all our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, we ſtill offend, it is a ſign that we muſt uſe ſome other diligence; and therefore we ſhould be induced ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fortifie our reſolutions by ſo powerfull a means, than to abſtain from it. For they that neglect it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are weak, may juſtly fear leſt they be therefore weak, becauſe they live in neglect of a known duty. Let it be the endeavour then of all thoſe that ſtudy to live godlily, though they be feeble and tottering, to underſtand the true uſe and benefit of this duty, and then to perform it for this end, that they may be ſtrengthened and confirmed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Yea ſixthly, If thou breakeſt thy reſolution after thou haſt received theſe holy Pledges, and feeleſt but little ſtrength; <hi>yet let it not deterre thee from receiving, but rather make thee frequent it the more,</hi> that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of this action may do that, which a ſingle act was not able to do. For this Sacrament was inſtituted for the weak, more than for the ſtrong, though it be neceſſary for both; and it is likely men remain therefore weak,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:31853:165"/>becauſe they ſeed ſo ſeldome, and let the received ſtrength decay, before they give it a freſh repaſt. But if they ſtill forbear when they are ſenſible of a conſumption, what can be expected but a dangerous languiſhment? If thou haſt not got the victory by the uſe of this weapon, thou canſt not think but to be worſted and foiled by the neglect of it. If thou haſt received no more ſtrength againſt thy luſts by this ſtrong food, how ſhalt thou hope by a weaker and thin diet, to be able to wreſtle with them? Approve then thy reſolutions to be ſmcere, and ſtir up thy hunger more frequently; awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thy appetite, that thou mayeſt feed more heartily; and ſo come with hopes through the Grace of God, thou mayeſt get further ground of them, and give them (at leaſt) a deeper wound, though they may not preſently be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under thy feet. But if ſtill thou findeſt no encreaſe of ſtrength, nor their prevalency abate, I dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thee that thou ſhouldſt ſtay away, but ſearch thy heart more narrowly, if thou waſt not too ſleight in thy former reſolution, and beareſt not ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:31853:165"/>favour to thy ſinne, and haſt not ſome latent unwillingneſs that they ſhould be ſlain. And be aſſured, that if thou conſtantly uſe the means (that God hath appointed) of Prayer and Watchfulneſs, calling him in daily to thy aſſiſtance, thou ſhalt at laſt get the better. For <hi>nothing can</hi> mortifie us, <hi>if the death of</hi> Chriſt cannot; and never <hi>is the power</hi> of his death more felt, than <hi>when we</hi> thus ſolemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it. Therefore do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that thou muſt wait, till by ſome other means thou canſt effect that thing, which is to be done chiefly by thoſe means which thou art afraid of.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then this Diſcourſe, Let me entreat all ſerious Chriſtians, that they would more attentively heed their own encreaſe in Grace, by this food, that ſo they may encourage the weaker ſort to make uſe of it, when by their own experience they can tell them what Life and Spirit it doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. And what the heed and care is, which you ſhould take, I have already told you: The ſumme of which is this: Excite your hunger,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:31853:166"/>quicken your thirſt, and ſharpen your appetite after righteouſneſs, and all the benefits that are to be enjoyed by Chriſt. Labour to remove all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and ſtoppings that may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the free diſtribution of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into all the parts. Sound men may ſometimes be ſo clog'd with colds and diſtempers which they have caught, that their meat may do them little good, but only engender more rhumes and oppilations, and make them more indiſpoſed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Phyſick will do well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and cleanſe the wayes for their food, that it may freely paſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe it ſelf through the body. Even ſo may &amp; good man happen to be ſo loaded with ſome Worldly Buſineſs, and his thoughts may be ſo mixed with ſome Affairs, that a damp may be caſt upon his affections, and his ſpirits may move but ſluggiſhly, and at that time be may perceive but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in any Heavenly Food. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt take ſome time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move theſe impediments, and caſt off theſe weights. He muſt blot theſe worldly Images (as much as he can)
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:31853:166"/>out of his fancy, and diſcharge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his earthly thoughts and cares. And then having emptied himſelf of thoſe ill humours that he had inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly contracted, he may with the greater clearneſs of ſoul, and more profit to himſelf, partake of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nutriment. We may compare the beſt of men to a Clock, which though it commonly go true, and be conſtantly wound up, and lookt after, yet muſt ſometimes be more exactly cleanſed and new oyled, or elſe it will begin to move more ſlowly, and not to keep time ſo evenly; and moiſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, you know, and bad weather, are apt to foul it, and to clog the wheels in their motion. There will be duſt falling upon our heart, which we muſt often be bruſhing off; ruſt will be growing, while we are expoſed to ſuch variety of ſeaſons and occaſions in the world; and examination, with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſevere truths to our hearts, will be as a file to brighten them, and furbiſh them again, without which they will be unfit for the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our Maſter, and unprepared for any duty that we are to go about.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:31853:167"/>But to keep more cloſe to the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of Eating and Drinking, you know that the ſtrongeſt and moſt healthy perſon that is, had need ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to have the natural heat excited, the vital ſpirits rouzed and awakened by exerciſe and ſtirring, elſe he loſeth his appetite, and his meat makes him but more ſluggiſh, by oppreſſing thoſe ſpirits more heavily, which before were too much burdened. Even ſo before we come to this Table of the Lord, though we be ſound in his wayes, and upright before him, yet we muſt by the exerciſes of examination, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and prayer, by the diſcuſſion of our Conſciences, and by the ſtirring up the Graces of God that are in us, put our ſelves into a meet temper for to eat, and by quickening of our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, receive the more nouriſhment, and get the greater ſtrength by this food of our ſouls. For this you muſt remember, that as this food nouriſhed the ſoul only by its own actions, and as it nouriſheth only the new man, which can put forth proper actions; ſo it is not likely to yeild any conſiderable ſtrength to that, without ſome fore-going moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and good exerciſes.</p>

                  <p>A Devout perſon being once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, What was the moſt forcible means that by long Experience he had proved, to help a man to pray well and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently: He anſwered, <hi>An holy life.</hi> And to their Enquiry, What he found available next to that: He ſtill returned the ſame Anſwer, <hi>An holy life;</hi> which is both ſecond, third, and all means elſe of praying devoutly. The like I have ſaid concerning Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Supper of the Lord: By a
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:31853:168"/>conſtant exerciſe of piety, we ſhall be more fit without other labour, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon our Lord, than he that is at the pains of a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Chriſtian, if he do not live holily. It is reported of them, That eight dayes before the receiving of the Sacrament, they drink nothing but water, and eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bread as dry as a bone. But if any of us could find in our hearts in this delicate Age, to uſe our ſelves with the like rigour, ſuch abſtinence would not make us ſo hungry, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently deſirous of this Heavenly Food, as a daily abſtinence from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden things, and a care to perform ſuch holy duties, as will maintain a lively ſenſe of God in our ſouls. Our aptneſs to heavenly converſes, confiſts not in ſome auſterities, and ſowre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, before we come to receive this ſweet food; but in a daily morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſeverity towards our ſelves, and in a ſtrict watch over our own hearts. Such perſons hearts are like to dry wood, and they can ſoon ſtir up the Grace of God that lodges there, and with one blaſt (as it were) kindle the flame of Love. Whereas the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:31853:168"/>hearts of other men having been ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World, are like green ſticks, that with all their puffing, blowing, and prayers, will ſcarce catch any fire.</p>
                  <p>If any now ſhould make a demand of the nature with that I mentioned, and enquire concerning the next thing that is to be treated of, How a good man ſhould order his behaviour and deportment at Gods Table? I might anſwer in one word, <hi>Love.</hi> Do but love, and that affection is inſtead of a thouſand Maſters, which will teach us all decent carriage, and beſeeming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to the perſon whom we love. You need not tell one that is in Love, what he ſhall ſay, or how he ſhall make his Addreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Love it ſelf is his Tutor, which is full of wit and invention, which forms it ſelf into apt expreſſions, and puts on become<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing geſtures, and turns it ſelf into all arts of inſinuation. I have read in an Anonymous Author, That he knew ſome Religious perſons, who all the while they were at this feaſt, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but only cry with heart and tongue, <hi>I love thee, O my Jeſus, truly
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:31853:169"/>I love thee O my Jeſus;</hi> reiterating this above an hundred times, and profeſſing that they found a ſingular comfort and conſolation, in theſe throbs and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of love in their heart unto him. It ſeems their love taught them, that their Lord would be beſt pleaſed, if they threw themſelves into his arms, (as it were) and told him that they were ſo full of love, that they could not hold; and yet were ſo inebriated, that they could not tell what to ſay, but only that they loved him. But he ſaith he knew others that would ſay nothing, but endeavoured to keep their ſoul from all thoughts whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that they might hear the voice of Chriſt within them, when all their affections were huſht and ſtill. It ſhould ſeem that their Love taught them, that it would be beſt to be ſo modeſt as to let their Lord ſpeak firſt, or rather ſpeak all, and they ſit and hearken to his ſweet voice within them, alluring them to himſelf. Thus Love guides every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the temper and complexion of his ſoul, to make his Addreſſes in that manner which will be moſt pleaſing to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:31853:169"/>his Saviour, and breed moſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But this very love that is thus quick and ſharp, and knows how to tell its mind, and obtain its end, is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it will enquire of others, if they can afford it any aſſiſtance that may poliſh and refine it to a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of purity. And as you have ſeen in the former diſcourſe, That holineſs conſiſts of ſeveral actions of our life very different and various, ſo it is here to be conſidered, that love delights to break forth in ſeveral acts, and the ſoul finds vent for it ſelf in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, according as the objects preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do open a paſſage, and make their way into our heart. Now it will be but fit that when we come to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the great love of our Lord, we ſhould let the expreſſions of our love be as various as we can, and ſuffer our ſouls to burſt out as many wayes as there are occaſions offered. When there is an holy fervour inkindled in them, let them exhale in ſundry thoughts, and divers breathings of a devout affection, that they may ſend up a perfume of many ſpices unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:31853:170"/>Only if we feel our hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale and evaporate in one thought or deſire more than another, with ſuch a freedome and pleaſure, as though they had a mind to ſpend themſelves in that alone; let us not ſtop the paſſage of thoſe ſweet odours, nor quench that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of our ſpirits, by turning them to any other thing. But rather let us help it forward, till we find it grow weak and languiſhing; and then it will be moſt profitable and pleaſant alſo to open ſome other port at which the ſoul may ſally forth upon a new object, and be encountred with freſh delights.</p>
                  <p>And truly, conſidering that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready led you by the hand as far as the Table of the Lord, methinks I might leave you there to your own Meditations upon that matter which I have prepared to your thoughts. Thoſe minds that are impregnated with good motions, ſhould be all ready (methinks) to teem forth themſelves into moſt proper Meditations at the ſight of their deareſt Lord, without any further directions. But yet I conſider again, that the ſtrongeſt Army for want of Order and good Diſcipline, may do but
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:31853:170"/>little ſervice; and that a throng of thoughts, if they be not well ranged and diſpoſed, may thruſt themſelves forward to the diſturbance and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of each other. And therefore I ſhall endeavour to ſet thoſe thoughts which I conceive will be in all good minds, in their right place, that they may iſſue forth, and ſecond each other to our greateſt advantage, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us moſt acceptable ſervice.</p>

                  <p>IT will be well becoming Chriſtian Piety, to welcome the day that brings our Saviour ſo near unto us with acts of joy and thankſgiving, for the approach of ſo great a bleſſing. And ſince one night may breed too great a damp and chilneſs upon our ſpirits, it will be very wholeſome to renew thoſe thoughts and affections that we left there when we went to bed, and ſo go to the Houſe of God in a ſenſe of our unworthineſs to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo glorious a Perſon, and in a ſenſe of ſinne, which is the cauſe of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:31853:171"/>together with a joy in our ſouls, and praiſes upon our tongues, that he will forgive them, humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring of the Lord that he will accept of us for his habitation, and that he will come and enlarge our ſouls by a holy love to him, and longing after him, that there may be room for his Sacred Majeſty, and a place clean and dreſſed for to receive him.</p>
                  <p>And then when the time comes that this holy ſervice begins, we muſt put on ſuch affections as are moſt agreeable to the ſeveral parts of the action.

And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ought diligently to attend unto thoſe Exhortations and Perſwaſions which he ſhall uſe, and to endeavour that our hearts may be affected with them. But
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:31853:171"/>theſe are ſuch things as you can eaſily inſtruct your ſelves about, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will apply my Diſcourſe to more particular conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. When you ſee the Miniſter ſtand at the Table of the Lord to conſecrate the Bread and Wine by Prayer, and the words of Chriſts Inſtitution, then ſend up <hi>an act of wonder and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that the Son of God ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the food of ſouls by dying for us.</hi> Then theſe words (ſo anciently uſed) <hi>Surſam Corda, Lift up your hearts,</hi> ſhould ſound in all our ears, and our ſouls ſhould ſpread their wings, that by the divine inſpirations they may be mounted unto Heaven in adoring thoughts. Nothing more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes this Sacred Myſtery, than ſuch a dumb admiration; and the love of our Lord is not better praiſed by any thing, than <hi>loquaciſsimo illo ſilentio</hi> (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his phraſe is) by that moſt talkative ſilence. When the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the ſoul grow too big for the mouth; when it lifts up it ſelf in ſpeaking-thoughts; and this is their language, That they are not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Miracles of this Love, it
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:31853:172"/>ſhall not be long before it perceive how much God is pleaſed with its ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing. Let us therefore labour at the very entrance, to put our ſelves into ſome degree of wonderment, to think what manner of love this is wherewith he hath loved us. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he ſhould dye for thee, when he was upon the earth, and that he ſhould nouriſh thee with himſelf now that he is in the Heavens. Be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that Heaven ſhould ſo conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Earth, and Man ſhould be ſo united unto God. Loſe thy thoughts in contemplation of the ſtrangeneſs of this kindneſs, that God ſhould dwell in fleſh, and that this fleſh ſhould be our Food. Let it amaze thee that Chriſt can never think that he hath given himſelf enough to thee; but (as the Apoſtle ſaith) he gave himſelf to redeem us from our ſinnes, and now he gives himſelf to be the ſtrength and health of our ſouls. He gave himſelf when he was among men, he gives himſelf now that he is with God, and (as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> relates the ſtory) he told a pious man in a viſion, That if it were neceſſary he
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:31853:172"/>would come and die again for the ſons of men. This would be a rarely good beginning of this holy ſervice, and we ſhould be fitter for all following acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if we could put our hearts into a kind of extaſie or admiration at the ſtupendious greatneſs of this myſtery. If our thoughts were once got ſo high, we ſhould be out of the reach of other things that are apt to thruſt themſelves in, and interrupt us. If we had once climbed above our ſelves, and were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven, we ſhould not be inticed while the Solemnity laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to come down to the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. When we ſee the Bread broken, and the Wine poured out, it is a fit ſeaſon to entertain our ſelves with theſe <hi>three Meditations,</hi> which are big with a great number of other thoughts that they will bring forth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Remember the pains and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, the ſhame and reproach which our Lord endured. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe imagine as if you were in <hi>Golgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> the place where he was crucified, think that you behold him ſtretched forth upon a Croſs, that you ſee his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:31853:173"/>precious Bloud trickling down his ſide; and that you look into his gaping wounds; think that you ſee the pits that they digged in his hands and his feet, the furrows that they made in his back, and how miſerably the Thorns ſcratched and harrowed his holy head. Think that you hear his dying groans, that the mocks and flouts of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſound in your ears. Yea, think that you hear the groans of the Earth under the weight of his Croſs; and that you ſee how the Sun ſhrunk in his head, as aſhamed to look on ſuch a ſpectacle, and affrighted with the horror of ſuch a ſight. And when you have meditated a while up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe wonders, it will be greater wonder if there be no paſſion made in your hearts. Your own thoughts will teach you ſuch reſentments as befit ſo ſtrange an object, and you will begin to tremble, and bleed, and deſire, and rejoyce, and be in ſuch a mixture of paſſions, as if you would imitate the confuſion which was in the world at his Sufferings.</p>
                  <p>But when you have recovered your ſelf a little, think that it will be moſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:31853:173"/>agreeable in the ſecond place,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To remember with due affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great love of our Lord in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf to ſuch pains and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace for our ſakes. Never did eyes behold ſuch a ſtrange thing, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten of the Father ſhould bleed like a Malefactor; that the glorious King of Heaven ſhould dye for his own Subjects, Rebels I ſhould rather call them, and Traytors to their Soveraign Lord. Was there ever any kindneſs like to this? Was there ever ſuch a Furnace of Love burning in any heart? Could he do more for us, than dye for us? Was there any likelihood that the remembrance of ſuch a Love ſhould dye? That mens hearts ſhould freeze over ſuch a fire? Leſt ſuch a thing ſhould happen, he hath left himſelf ſtill among us in ſymboles and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſets before our eyes his bloody Death and Paſſion; he makes himſelf preſent to our faith; and as if he would do more than <hi>dye</hi> for us, he deſires to <hi>live</hi> for ever in us, and be united to us. How can we chuſe then but fall into his arms? Yea, how can we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our ſelves from running into his
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:31853:174"/>heart? Can any heart refrain it ſelf from tears of ſorrow, to think of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs? and from tears of joy to think of his ſtrange love? how can we be but overwhelmed both with floods of grief and gladneſs? Can we look upon him whom we have pierced, and not mourn? Can we ſee his bleeding wounds, and not be troubled? What heart can be ſo hard? It cannot but pain us to think that we love him no more, who put himſelf to ſuch pains for us. It cannot but trouble us to think that but hearts ſhould be ſo cold, when his was ſo hot with love, as to ſend out its life bloud for our redemption. And yet when we conſider, that in this ſtream of blood our ſouls are waſhed, and that by his ſtripes we are healed, who can chuſe but rejoyce in his love, and hope that he will accept of our poor acknowledgements? And let us but look upon him again as I deſcribed him on the Croſs, and we ſhall find our love more large and vehement. Think that you hear him ſaying to you as he hangs there, Behold (my friends) how my fleſh was torn and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for your ſakes! See how your
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:31853:174"/>ſinnes have uſed me: Look into my heart which was pierced firſt by love, and then by a ſpear for you. See how my hands and my feet were bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through: look how my blood runs out to fetch you home to God. Was there ever any ſorrow like to my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? Hath any one loved you ſo as I have loved you? Behold here I give my ſelf unto you, as once I gave my ſelf for you. By theſe tokens of Bread and Wine, I conveigh unto you all that I have, and make over to you all that Inheritance which I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by my Blood. My Self, and all that I have, I freely give unto you. Need any one (now) that hath ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, be taught with what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he ſhould behave himſelf towards his Lord? Needs there any piercing words of him that miniſters to wound mens ſouls with ſorrow and grief? Is any artifice of ſpeech required to wind and inſinuate Chriſt into their hearts? Is any perſwaſive Language neceſſary to make them accept of the greateſt and richeſt Bleſſings that all Heaven can afford? Me thinks I ſee the pricking and compunction that will be
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:31853:175"/>in a heart that thinks of theſe things. Me thinks I ſee ſuch a ſoul running forth to meet and embrace its graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord. Me thinks I behold it preparing a gift of its whole ſelf to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto him; and ſuch flames of Love ſeem to be kindling as if it would flye up to Heaven. But ſtay, it muſt firſt caſt one look downward towards its ſinfull ſelf, before it can think of getting up ſo high, and of being a gift accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God. It could not indeed but think of giving the beſt it had to him who gave all himſelf to it: But alas! the time of Sacrifice is not yet come, and it is not good enough for to begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him. It will try if it can make it ſelf a little better (though never good enough) before it offer up it ſelf, by making its ſinnes feel the weight and ſharpneſs of Chriſts Croſs, that they may all dye. It will make a ſlaughter of them, and then a ſacrifice of it ſelf, which is the third Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have to recommend to your thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider how odious, vile and intollerable every ſin is, that brought our Lord to ſuch miſeries, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:31853:175"/>ſuch a Blood to expiate it. This hatred of ſinne proceeds from great Love; and the viler we ſee it is, the more will our love encreaſe to him that will pardon ſuch a ſhamefull act. Think therefore, what is that which makes God ſo angry? What bloudy thing is it which drinks the Bloud of Chriſt himſelf? What hideous Monſter that could not be ſatisfied with the fleſh of all the World? What curſed thing that the Son of God became a curſe for it? The thoughts of Chriſts Croſs is enough to affright a man out of the very Arms and pleaſant Embraces of a Luſt; it is enough to reſcue a ſoul that is in the mouth of Hell, and ready to go down the throat of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit. If it can but find any place to take hold of, it can drag a man out of the very Jaws of the Monſter; and it can Arm the revenge of the verieſt doting Lover that ever courted ſinne, and turn his wrath againſt it. But. then how amiable doth the goodneſs of God appear, that he would paſs by ſo many offences, and require no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from us for ſuch inſufferable wrongs? How great was his love, that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:31853:176"/>he would transferre the puniſhment from us unto his Son? and how great was his Sonnes Love, that he would bear our iniquities, that by his ſtripes we might be healed? Nay, none can tell, nor think how great the love was; but the more hainous and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous our offences ſeem, the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly will it ſhine in our eyes; and again, the more lovely God appears, the more ſhall we hate ſin that does any injury to ſo good a God. Let us therefore ſtay our thoughts here a while, and think we hear Chriſt ſay to us, You have lookt into my wounds, and have ſeen into my very heart; if you have any eyes, ſure you cannot but diſcern what hath put me into this gore. Do you not ſee how ſinne ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in my ſides, and tare my very heart? Do you not ſee how greedily it ſuckt my bloud? Behold the very print of its nails; ſee here the very place where it hath thruſt its Spear. You ſay you are my friends, will you not take my part againſt your ſins? Have not all theſe Wounds mouthes enough to entreat you to fall out with ſin? Would you have me uſed thus
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:31853:176"/>again? Could you find in your heart to ſee me once more upon a Gibbet? Why then can you not be perſwaded by the remembrance of my ſufferings for you? Why do you not ſpit in the face of your ſinnes? Why do you not buffet and beat them, and do all the deſpight you can unto them? yea, why do you not revenge me perfectly upon them, and cry crucifie them, crucifie them; not theſe, but Chriſt only? Why do I not ſee them here nailed to my Croſs, never to be taken down till they be quite dead? If you would have me embrace you, ſay, None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt; Chriſt and Wounds, Chriſt and a Croſs, Chriſt and Death (if he will) ſhall be our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>What, I beſeech you, would our hearts eccho back again, if we thought that we heard him groaning ſuch words from the Croſs unto us? What a fury and a rage would it put us into againſt theſe bloody ſinnes? With what a forwardneſs ſhould we arm our ſelves againſt them? With what a revenge ſhould we flye upon them? We could not but with all ſpeed drag them to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:31853:177"/>the Croſs, and torture them to death. We could not but paſs ſentence, and do the ſevereſt execution upon them. Though they begg'd never ſo much for life, the voice of Chriſt would drown their cryes. Though all their friends &amp; familiars entreated for them, their Petitions would be caſt out. Though our eyes ſhould pity them, and beſeech that they might be ſpared, though our Tongues and Pallates ſhould plead for their life, though all our ſenſes, though every part of our fleſh ſhould ſolicite in their behalf, yet we ſhould never endure that our Lord ſhould be diſguſted and affronted any more by them. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Complices, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> took his Bloudy Garments, and ſpread them before the eyes of the people, as if every hole which their Daggers had made, would ſpeak an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration unto them. Behold (ſaid he) the Bloud of your Emperor, ſee here the wounds they have given unto him. Can you love theſe Paracides that have ſtickt him like a Beaſt? Can you look with patience upon the Butchery they have committed? Can you look
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:31853:177"/>through theſe Clothes, without fire in your eyes? And immediately he ſo moved the multitude by that artifice, and the vehemency of his Oration, that they run upon the houſes of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, as Tygers or Wolves upon their Prey, and would as certainly have torn them in pieces, as a Lion doth a Kid, in the heat of his anger, but that they were before fled from the danger. Cannot then the repreſentation, not of the rent Garments of our Saviour, but of his very broken Body, more move a conſiderate heart againſt ſin, which was the ſlaughterer? Cannot the very ſign of his ſacred Blood pierce with greater Rhetorick into his ſoul? Think that thou heareſt Chriſt himſelf ſay, Behold my Wounds: See here the breaches in my Body; Look upon me whom they have pierced: Read in me the cruelty of thy ſins. Canſt thou hug and imbrace theſe bloody Parricides? Canſt thou ſhew any kindneſs to ſo vile an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy? Haſt thou the patience to hear me ask any more Queſtions, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with thee any further? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the middle of ſuch thoughts as theſe, the heart of a man could not but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:31853:178"/>take fire, and be ſo incenſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked againſt all his ſins, that he would leave them all dead at the foot of Chriſt. Not one of them could eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, but every mans hand would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his particular luſt, and there they ſhould lie bleeding as ſo many ſacrifices at the Altar of the Lord. For who could lie under the load of ſin when he beheld Chriſt groaning upon the Croſs for it? whoſe heart could remain unbroken, when he ſaw his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy broken for us? who could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his eyes from tears, when he ſaw the Wounds of Chriſt weeping blood for us? Behold O Lord! would ſuch a mans ſoul anſwer unto him, I am ſorry that my ſins have liv'd ſo long. It was ſore againſt my will that there ſhould be any of them now to kill; fain would I have had their lives, but they are hitherto overſtrong for me. O do thou ſtrike my ſoul through with a ſenſe of thy ſufferings, and they will not be able to endure thy hand. Do thou transfix me firſt with a ſenſe of my baſeneſs, and then with a ſenſe of thy love, and ſure they cannot but die when they feel thy pains. I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:31853:178"/>not to carry away one of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. If they had a thouſand lives, they ſhould loſe them all, that my ſoul may live to thee.</p>
                  <p>How it would delight our Lord to hear ſuch language in mens hearts, it is not for me to expreſs; nor can you imagine how you ſhould pleaſe him better, and draw him more powerfully into your armes, then by ſuch diſcourſe within your ſelves. Nor can you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think to get the victory over your ſins, and bring them under your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and diſpleaſure, if ſuch a ſight as Chriſt crucified before your eyes, be not able to effect it. Never will they be killed, if they can outlive the ſight of a bleeding Saviour. Never ſhall we get them under our power, if they can eſcape with their lives, when we remember ſo ſolemnly his accurſed death.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. When we ſee him that miniſters, come to give the bread unto us, let us employ our ſelves in theſe three Acts of Devotion:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It will well become a <hi>ſoul to ſink into a very deep humility,</hi> and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it ſelf in the ſenſe of its own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:31853:179"/>When thou ſeeſt that Chriſt is coming (as it were) towards thy houſe, Run forth to meet him at the door before he come in, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him with an act of reverence, worſhip, and humble obeyſance to him. Say, Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhould'ſt come under my Roof; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not the crumbs that fall from thy Table. Say as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Boaz,</hi> (<hi>Ruth</hi> 2.10.) after ſhe had bowed her ſelf to the ground, <hi>Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou ſhouldſt take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of me, ſeeing I am a ſtranger?</hi> How comes it that my Lord ſhould caſt his eye upon me? What am I, that he ſhould viſit me, and come to marry himſelf unto me? And when thou haſt depreſſed thy ſelf a while at his feet; Then</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Riſe a little up again, and mix ſome Acts of love with this humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> Think of the infinite love of God, that would give his own Son; think of the infinite love of Chriſt that would ſo graciouſly come to ſave us, and would leave us theſe remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and tokens of his love. Wiſh that thou hadſt a thouſand hearts to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:31853:179"/>with ſo great a love. Say within thy ſelf, Oh Lord! What am I that thou ſhouldeſt command me for to love thee? What compare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and thee, that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſo much deſire to make me a viſit, and give to me an embracement? Whence comes it, that thou who art in Heaven, among them who know ſo well how to love and ſerve thee, wilt vouchſafe to deſcend to me, who know little elſe but how to offend thee? Is it poſſible, O Lord, that thou canſt not content thy ſelf to be without me? Did thy meer love draw thee down from Heaven for my ſake? Doſt thou ſtill give thy ſelf unto me, as if thou couldſt never be mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? Who can abide the heat of this love? Who can feel thy heart and not be burnt up? There is none can dwell in ſuch flames without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. No ſoul that can abide in the body, if a great ſenſe of this love do long abide. We muſt therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat our gracious Lord, that he would ſtay for the full meaſure of our love, till he hath made us able to do nothing elſe but love him.</p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:31853:180"/>
                  <p>And thirdly, <hi>Let us turn our Love into deſire.</hi> Let us beſeech him to fill us with his holy Spirit, and to dwell in us by all his divine graces. Say, Lord! ſince thou art pleaſed to come and offer thy ſelf unto me, My ſoul thirſteth for thee even as the thirſty Land; I humbly ſtretch out my hands unto thee;<note place="margin">Pſal. 143.6.</note> I open my mouth wide, that thou mayeſt fill me. O ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſoul with thy likeneſs! O let me taſte that the Lord is gracious! And you may be aſſured that the Lord loves a ſoul that lies in ſuch a poſture ready to receive him, that gaſps and longs after him, and ſaith in its heart, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 73.25.</note> 
                     <hi>and there is none on earth beſides thee.</hi> Stir up thy appetite therefore, and come to him as a chaſed Hart to the ſtreams of water, as an hungry man unto a Feaſt, as a Bride unto her Wedding, a thouſand times deſired. Labour to feel ſomething like to thoſe longings, that ſo thou mayſt taſte and ſavour his love the more, and it may leave a ſweeter guſt and reliſh upon thy ſoul, and thy mouth may praiſe him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with joyfull lips.</p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:31853:180"/>
                  <p n="4">IV. When we take the Bread into our hands, it is ſeaſonable time to do that Act which I told you was one end of this Sacrament, <hi>viz. Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and ſhew forth or declare the Death of Chriſt unto God the Father.</hi> Let us repreſent before him the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of atonement that Chriſt hath made; let us commemorate the pains which he indured, let us intreat him that we may enjoy all the purchaſe of his Blood, that all people may reap the fruit of his Paſſion; and that for the ſake of his bloudy ſacrifice he will turn away all his anger and diſpleaſure, and be reconciled unto us. <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> (they ſay) not knowing how to mitigate, and atone the wrath of King <hi>Admetus,</hi> and avert his fury from him, ſnatcht up the Kings Son, and held him up in his armes between himſelf and death, and ſo prevailed for a pardon, and quenched the fire that was break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt him. And this the <hi>Moloſsians</hi> (of whom he was King) held to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> in Themiſt.</note> 
                     <hi>the moſt effectual way of ſupplication,</hi> and which of all others <hi>could not be reſiſted or denied.</hi> Of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:31853:181"/>far greater prevalency is this Act, the holding up (as it were) the Son of God in our hands, and repreſenting to the Father the broken body, and the Bloud of his onely begotten. Let us ſet this between the heat of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and our ſouls; let us deſire he would have regard to his dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Lord cannot turn back our Prayers that preſs and importune him with ſuch a mighty argument. Say therefore to him, Behold, O Lord! the ſacrifice of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; behold we lay before thee the Lamb that takes away the ſins of the World. Is not thy ſoul in him well pleaſed? Is not his Body as really in the Heavens, as the ſigns of it are here in our hands? Hear good Lord! the cry of his Wounds. Let us prevail with thee through the virtue of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Let us feel, yea, let all the World feel the power of his interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Deny us not, O Lord, ſeeing we bring thy Son with us. Hear thy Son O Lord, though thou wilt not hear us, and let us, let all others know <hi>that he lives and was dead, and that he is alive for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:31853:181"/>
                  <p>And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> It is a ſeaſonable time to <hi>profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians,</hi> and that we will take up our Croſs and follow after him. This <hi>taking</hi> of the bread, we ſhould look upon as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the yoke of Chriſt upon our neck, and laying his Croſs upon our ſhoulder, if he think fit. We em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a crucified Jeſus, and we are not to expect to live in pleaſures, unleſs they be ſpiritual; nor to rejoice with the world, but to endure affliction, and account it all joy when we fall into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold temptations. Proteſt therefore unto him, that thou loveſt him as thou ſeeſt him, <hi>ſtript</hi> and <hi>naked, bruiſed</hi> and <hi>wounded, ſlain</hi> and <hi>dead;</hi> and that thou art contented to take joyfully the ſpoiling of thy goods, to be pleaſed with pains, and to count death the way to life.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. When we eat, it is a fit ſeaſon to put forth theſe two acts of faith:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us <hi>expreſs our hearty conſent that Chriſt ſhall dwell within us,</hi> that we will be ruled by his Laws, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Spirit, that he ſhall be the alone King of our ſouls, and the Lord of all our faculties; and that we
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:31853:182"/>will have no other Maſter but onely him, to give commands within us. Eating I told you is a foederal rite, and therefore when we have ſwallowed this bread, we ſhould think that we have ſurrendred all up into his hands, and put him into full power over our ſouls. And we ſhould think alſo, that we have given him the poſſeſſion of our ſouls for ever, and engaged never to change our Maſter. For <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is more receiving, then <hi>taking</hi> a thing with our hands: It is, as it were, the incorporating of the thing with the ſubſtance of our bodies, and making it a part of our ſelves, that it may laſt as long as we. So ſhould we meditate, that we receive the Lord Jeſus never to be ſeparated from his ſervice, for ever to adhere unto him as our Prince and Captain, as our Head and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whereſoever his Commands will lead us. And as we open our hearts thus to receive him, ſo let us now fold him in our arms, and embrace him with a moſt cordial affection. Let the fire burn now, and make us boyl up, yea even run over with love to him. Now is the time not onely to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:31853:182"/>give our ſelves to him, but to make a ſacrifice of our ſelves, as a whole burnt-offering unto God. Now ſhould we lay our ſelves on the Altar of the Lord, to be offered up intirely to him who made his ſoul an offering for ſin. That there may not only be a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, but a real ſacrifice at this Feaſt, unto Heaven, <hi>i.e.</hi> that we may not only ſhew forth the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and repreſent it before God, but we our ſelves may offer up our ſouls and bodies unto him, and ſend them up in flames of love, as ſo many Holocauſts to be conſumed and ſpent in the ſervice of our God. Then let us wiſh for the flames of a <hi>Seraphim</hi> in the love of God, for the cheerfulneſs and ſpeed of a <hi>Cherubim</hi> in the ſervice of God, and for the voice of an Angel that we may ſing the praiſes of God. Let us like our choice ſo well, and think that we are ſo beholden to him, that we may give our ſelves to him, as to begin to leap for joy that we have parted with our ſelves, and are become his.</p>
                  <p>And as a token that we give our ſelves and all we have to God, we ſhould now think upon thoſe offerings
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:31853:183"/>we intend to make for the poor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt, and deſire the Lord to accept of our gifts which we preſent him withall, as <hi>earneſts</hi> of our ſelves, which we have conſecrated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And perhaps now our hearts may be ſtirred with ſo great compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our bowels may be ſo feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved, that our Charity may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the banks that we had ſet it, and the fire that is within us may require a fatter and larger offering then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. But howſoever we cannot but deal our bread to the hungry with a more cheerfull hand, and give our Almes with a freer heart, when we have received the Bread of Life into our hands and hearts, and felt what the huge Charity of our Lord was toward us moſt miſerable and wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond Act of faith which we ſhould now exerciſe, is this: Let us really believe that all the bleſſings of the New Covenant are made over to us by this <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> of his ſacred body. Let thy ſoul ſay, <hi>My beloved is mine, as I am his.</hi> Be confident and well aſſured, that if thou
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:31853:183"/>waſt hearty in the former act of ſaith, thou ſhalt as certainly receive pardon, and grace, and ſtrength, and ſalvation, as thy mouth thou art ſure eateth the holy Bread.</p>
                  <p>The former Act was a receiving him as <hi>our Lord;</hi> and this <hi>as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> Think therefore that now Chriſt dwelleth in thee, and thou in him, that as he muſt be Maſter of the houſe, ſo thou ſhalt partake of all his riches, of all his honour and pleaſure. And ſo begin to ranſack his treaſures, deſire him to ſpread before thee his ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches; pray him to ſhew thee if it be but a little glimpſe of the glory of the inheritance of the Saints. And what joy will this create in thy ſoul, when thou thinkeſt that thou and Chriſt are one; that thou art united to his moſt precious Body, and ſhall certainly receive all the benefits of his Death and Paſſion? O what raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould it be unto us, to believe that ſin ſhall not have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us; that the Blood of Jeſus cleanſeth us from all unrighteouſneſs; that the flames of Hell ſhall never touch us; that death is ſwallowed up
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:31853:184"/>in victory; that the grave is buried in the Wounds of our Saviour; that we are ſealed with the mark of God, and conſigned to a bleſſed immortality, and ſhall inherit the joys of our Lord! With what boldneſs now may we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our requeſts to him, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately plead with him for a ſupply of all our wants? We may put up ſtronger cries now that we conceive he is in us, and intreat him ſince it is his pleaſure to be ſo familiar with us, that we may be filled with all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. O my Lord! (may a ſoul ſay) if thou loveſt me ſo much, fulfill in me all the good pleaſure of thy goodneſs,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.11.</note> and the work of faith with power.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.13.</note> Fill me with all joy and peace in believing. Let me abound in hope.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3 17.</note> Let me be rooted and grounded in love. If I have found favour in thine eyes, let me be filled with the holy Ghoſt. How ſayſt thou that thou loveſt me, if I have no more love unto thee, no more life from thee, and if I be ſo barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull in good Works? O my Lord, I take the boldneſs lovingly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to thee, and expoſtulate with
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:31853:184"/>thee. Why am I ſo dull and cold in thy ſervice? why am I ſo unwilling to execute thy commands? why am I ſo weak and unable againſt the enemies aſſaults? If thou be with me, who can be againſt me; Surely the Lord God is a Sun and a Shield; the Lord will give grace and glory, no good thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly.<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.11.</note> Through thee I ſhall do valiantly, thou ſhalt tread down all my enemies.<note place="margin">Pſal. 60.12. Pſal. 57.2.</note> It is the Lord that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth all things for me.

                  <p>When we have done theſe things with the beſt devotion we can, it will be a great refreſhment to the ſoul, if we turn it a little towards thoſe who are the friends of your Lord. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Sixthly, When we ſee him give the ſame Bread to others, let us renew Acts of Love unto our Brethren. Let us think that we being many, are but one body, and that we are made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:31853:185"/>one of another. Let us ardently therefore embrace them in our armes; let us claſp about them as our friends; let us love one another with a pure heart fervently. If we feel not the flame hot enough, let us ſtir up in our minds again the remembrance of the dear love of our Lord, and that will make us burn in affection to each other. That will utterly put out all the ſparks of envy, anger, or malice, which are already buried, that they may never any more revive to glow in our ſouls. That will teach us a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect remedy againſt all ſuch diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed motions. Let us but reſolve that our thoughts ſhall dwell in the fide of Chriſt, and Hell can never ſhoot any of its fires unto us. If ever any of thoſe black and dark paſſions begin to reek, let us but preſently enter into his wounds, and they will all be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. When we feel but the loving warmth of his heart, all our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will turn into love, and all our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies will find us friends. Let us reſolve therefore now that we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his love to enemies, that we will never bear any hatred more. Let us
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:31853:185"/>reſolve now that we ſee how he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes himſelf to us all, that we will never contemn nor deſpiſe the meaneſt Brother, that the eye ſhall not ſay to the foot, I have no need of thee; that one member ſhall not ſtrike another; that we will live in all peace and love, bearing one anothers infirmities, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepting of reproofs, doing all the good we can to ſoul and body, that all men may know us to be Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. That we may do thus, let every man think as ſeriouſly as he can within himſelf: Did Chriſt dye only for me? Was his body broken for my ſake alone? Are not other perſons as dear unto him as my ſelf? Have we not all eaten of the ſame Loaf? Are we not about to drink of the ſame Cup? How ſhall I hate thoſe whom my Beloved loves? How ſhall I envy thoſe to whom he is ſo liberal? How ſhall I offend one of theſe for whom Chriſt dyed? How ſhall I deny my ſelf to him, to whom my Lord hath given himſelf? O my ſoul! haſt not thou eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed the ſame loves with thy bleſſed Lord? Muſt not all his friends and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations be thy kindred? Now he is not
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:31853:186"/>aſhamed to call them brethren. And therefore let them lye in my boſome, let my ſoul cleave unto them, let us keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</p>
                  <p>Such heavenly Aſpirations and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as theſe, would be as a ſweet perfume in our ſouls, that would make our Lord to like of his habitation the better; they would be as the fragrant Oyntment poured on the head of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal 133 2.</note> that would invite him to more ardent embraces, and give him the greater contentment in us.

Seventhly, When we receive the Cup, it is fit that we ſhould again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wonderfull love of God, that he would purchaſe us to himſelf by <hi>his own bloud.</hi> And we ſhould conſider the <hi>great and ineſtimable value</hi> of this bloud,<note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> that could make expiation, and give God full ſatisfaction for ſuch a world of offences. The <hi>infinite vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> likewiſe, as well as <hi>value</hi> of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ſhould be taken into our thoughts, which laſts for ever, and is now as freſh and full of efficacy as if the blood were newly ſhed upon the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:31853:187"/>Croſs.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.10.</note> For ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>This man after he had once offered for ſinne, for ever ſate down on the right hand of God.</hi> And that you may wonder more at the excellency of this Offering. Conſider how many ſinnes you have committed, and then gueſſe how many the ſinnes are which have been committed by all men that have been, are, and ſhall be in the World; and yet that this <hi>one Sacrifice</hi> is ſufficient in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to take away all, being of an everlaſting force and power. And the better again to conceive of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thing, compare it with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of old. One ſacrifice could take away but one offence among the Jews, and that meerly againſt a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Commandment, yet this though but <hi>one,</hi> can take away all offences even againſt the eternall Law of God. And the ſtrength of a Sacrifice under the Law, continued no longer than juſt while it was offered, but was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again in caſe of a new offence; but the bloud of Jeſus endures for ever,<note place="margin">Heb 10.14.</note> 
                     <hi>and by one offering he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever them that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:31853:187"/>We that live at ſixteen hundred years diſtance from that ſacrifice, may be as much expiated, and receive as great benefit by it, as they that ſaw him upon the Altar, or as he that put his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into his wounds, and thruſt his hand into his ſide. <hi>For the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all;</hi> and he bare the ſinnes not only of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but of all ſucceeding Ages. Think then now, that the Cup is in thy hands, now that thou drinkeſt of his bloud, that thou mayeſt receive as reall effects of his ſacrifice, as if thou hadſt been permitted to have laid thy hands on his head, and put all thy ſins upon him, as <hi>Aaron</hi> did upon the head of the Beaſt that was offered for the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And ſo let thy thoughts ſlide to a ſecond Meditation which is hereon depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And conſider with thy ſelf how firm that Covenant is which is made with us in the bloud of Jeſus, and how certainly God will perform whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Sonne hath promiſed. It is called the bloud of the <hi>everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13.20.</note> which doth intimate, that he
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:31853:188"/>ſealed the Covenant with his Bloud, that he died to aſſert the truth of all that he ſaid, he took it upon his death that he was ſent of God; and as he ſealed to it by his <hi>death,</hi> ſo God did ſeal to it by his <hi>reſurrection,</hi> which two put together, are the grand proofs which we have to ſhew for the truth of the Goſpel. And then we may be confident that the mercy of the Lord endures for ever; for the ſeal of the Covenant is <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and never fails. The firſt Covenant was made by bloud, as you may ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7, 8. yea, there is ſuch an affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe words, <hi>ſanctio</hi> and <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis,</hi> that in all likelihood their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſe from hence, becauſe by bloud all eſtabliſhments and ſanctions were wont to be made. But the Bloud of that Covenant vaniſhed away, and never roſe again, and ſo in time did the Covenant it ſelf, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. And therefore the Lord ſealed the new Compact by a better bloud, which is quickned again to an eternall life, to aſſure us that the mercies of it ſhall never ceaſe. Here therefore thy ſoul may again
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:31853:188"/>plead with God that he would put his Laws into thy heart, and write them in thy mind, and that thy ſins and iniquities he would remember no more, which is the ſum of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as it there follows in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles diſcourſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16, 17. Thou mayeſt grow confident, and rejoyce in God thy ſalvation; thou mayeſt deſire him to remember, that it is the precious. Bloud of his Sonne which thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt; thou mayeſt tell him that is not the bloud of Bulls and Goats that thou pleadeſt, but of Jeſus the Lamb of God, without ſpot and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. Thou mayeſt ask him if he do not ſee that Bloud in the Heavens; if he be not more pleaſed with it, than with the bloud of the Cattle upon a thouſand Hills. Say, Lord, is the Bloud of Jeſus dead? Doth it not cry as loud in thine ears as ever? Haſt thou not made him a Prieſt after the power of an endleſs life? yea, haſt thou not ſworn, and is it not impoſſible that thou ſhouldſt repent? Then I humbly crave that a poor ſinner which hath nothing to offer thee, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by that offering. Then let <hi>me</hi>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:31853:189"/>live by his Life as ſo many already have done. Let <hi>me</hi> know that thou art well pleaſed with ſinners through him: Let <hi>me</hi> know that I have found favour in thine eyes. Let all the Prayers that I have now made, be graciouſly accepted. Remember all my offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and accept of my ſacrifice of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Praiſes. Yea, remember his bloud, when I do not actually remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it; and when I am ſilent, and do not pray, let that prevail for bleſſings upon me.<note place="margin">Pſalm 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Doth not the King joy in thy ſtrength? Haſt thou not given him his hearts deſire, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden the requeſt of his lips? Thou haſt ſet a Crown of pure Gold upon his head. He asked Life of thee, and thou gaveſt it him, even length of dayes for ever and ever.

For thou haſt made him moſt bleſſed for ever: Thou haſt made him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad with thy Countenance: And therefore ſince he lives, let us live alſo: Since thou haſt heard him, hear us alſo for his ſake: Send us help out of thy Sanctuary, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

                  <p n="3">3. Meditate likewiſe what danger there is in not ſtanding to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that is here confirmed by bloud between God and us. They uſed when they made Covenants by bloud, to cut the Beaſt in ſunder, and both parties paſſed between the two halfs, (as you may ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.18, 19.) Which cuſtome was as old as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.10, 17, 18. will inform you. This paſſing of both parties between the parts of the Beaſt, was as much as a wiſh, that ſo it might befall him that ſhould break the Covenant which was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Now when we behold the Bloud of the Son of God poured out, and his Body broken, and ſo a Covenant ſtricken between God and us, by his receiving him into Heaven, and our drinking of his bloud, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Body here on Earth, we ſhould think what the danger will be of not being ſtedfaſt in his Covenant. God will require his Sonnes bloud at
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:31853:190"/>our hands. The Lord of that ſervant will come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, <gap reason="foreign">

I have often thought that he alludes to that cuſtome of cutting the Beaſt in twain, and that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, All perſons that are deceitfull and falſe,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.46.</note> or as St. <hi>Lukes</hi> phraſe is, <gap reason="foreign">

They ſhall be broken in pieces as his Son was broken. Yea, he will fall upon them as a ſtone, and grinde them to powder, ſeeing they would not love him as the Bread of Life bruiſed for them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.44. This ſad Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may not be unſeaſonable at a Feaſt of joy, no more than a little vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar in a mixture of many ſweets. And as dreadfull as it is, it may bring
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:31853:190"/>us the more abundant comfort after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by making us firm to God, and eſtabliſhing us in Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>But whether the <hi>Reader</hi> will think fit to meditate of this matter at that time or no; yet let me ſtay his thoughts a while now, and entreat him ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to think what the doom of all thoſe will be, who rebel againſt him to whom they have ſo often ſworn ſubjection. The love of God cannot make them love him; the Bloud of Chriſt cannot make them bleed, notwithſtanding the Death of Chriſt, they will dye; and all the bands that he can lay upon them, will not hold them faſt. O what chains of Darkneſs are they reſerved for, who break ſo many cords of love aſunder! What a ſacrifice muſt they be to the vengeance of God, whom the ſacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs could not deliver! The wrath of God will utterly conſume, and burn them up. They ſhall be a whole burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to his fiery indignation; they themſelves ſhall ſatisfie for their fins, and then he can never be ſatisfied. Theſe men take all the guilt of their
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:31853:191"/>ſinnes upon their own ſouls, and fearleſly go to Hell, as though they could bear his indignation, or fave themſelves from the fury of his anger. O let ſinners conſider what they do when they neglect ſo great ſalvation. So farre ſhall they be from being Chriſts and Saviours to themſelves, that they ſhall be their own Devils and Tormentors. Their ſpirits ſhall turn into fiends, and they ſhall miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably rage and fame againſt their own ſelves, and eternally crucifie their own hearts, in vexing and racking-thoughts. Their anger and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhall burn againſt their own ſouls, for their contempt of the Covenant of Grace: the bloud of Chriſt will call for their bloud; the pardon that was offered, will plead for no pardon; and all the Expence which God hath been at, will be charged upon them. What then will they do, when they ſhall be rendred guilty of the bloud of the Lord, when the Love of God it ſelf will be their accuſer, when they ſhall be oppreſſed, and caſt under an infinite debt which they can never pay? They muſt groan, and ſigh, and cry under the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:31853:191"/>burden to all eternity; and the Name of Chriſt which is ſo ſweet to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinners, will be a name of death and horror unto them, and the bloud of Chriſt, which is the life of all the holy Ones of God, will be like red and bloudy colours to ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which will make them raging mad. If I could exaggerate this as it deſerves, methinks I could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright a ſoul that is in the profoundeſt ſleep in the Devils Arms. And yet why ſhould I think ſuch a thought? if the bloud of Chriſt cannot do it, but men will dye in ſecure-ſinning, why ſhould we think to prevail? O think of the bloud of Chriſt therefore, and let it not be ſhed in vain. Think how angry he will be that his deareſt heart bloud ſhould be ſpilt on the ground like water, to no purpoſe at all as to thy ſoul. Think how it grieves him to ſee his love ſo undervalued; how it pierces him to ſee his bloud trodden under feet; into what anger his love will at laſt turn, and this will move thee more than all that I can ſay. If a man could ſpeak nothing but fire, and ſmoak, and bloud; if flames ſhould
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:31853:192"/>come out of his mouth inſtead of words; if he had a voice like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and an eye like lightning, he could not repreſent unto you the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe that make no reckoning of the bloud of the Sonne of God. <hi>The very Sun ſhall be turned into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle out of <hi>Joel, Acts</hi> 2.20.) <hi>and the Moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord,</hi> viz. the day when he ſhall come to deſtroy the Enemies of his Croſs. And yet he ſeems there to ſpeak but of one particular day of Judgement upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, who crucified the Lord of Life, and that was but a type and figure of the laſt day, and came far ſhort of the blackneſs and darkneſs of that time when the Lord will come to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on all them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus. How terrible would it be to ſee the Heavens all covered with clouds of blood, to feel drops of blood come raining down upon our heads; and next, ſhowres of fire from the melting Sun, come trickling upon our eyes; and then ſheets of flames
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:31853:192"/>wrapping about our bodies; to hear the earth groan, and the pillars of the world crack, as if the whole frame of Nature were a dying, and the world were tumbling into its Grave? All this would be but a petty image of that dreadfull Day, when the Son of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhall be cloathed with clouds of wrath, when his countenance ſhall be as flames of fire; when he ſhall cloath himſelf with vengeance as a Garment, when the Lamb of God himſelf ſhall roar like a Lyon, and the meek and compaſſionate Jeſus ſhall rend in pieces, and devour. There can be nothing more ſtrange, than for a Lamb to be angry, for a ſheep to tear and deſtroy. If he once gird his ſword upon his thigh, and reſolve to dip his feet in the blood of the wicked, it will be a diſmall, a bloudy day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and woe be to all thoſe on whom that dreadfull ſtorm ſhall fall, when the God of Heaven himſelf ſhall come in flaming fire to deſtroy his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For ever ſhall they lye wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own bloud, and all their bloud ſhall be turned into fire, and they ſhall bathe themſelves in ſtreams
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:31853:193"/>of Brimſtone, and roll themſelves in beds of flames, and their torment ſhall never ceaſe. Much rather would I have a Lyon ſatisfie his bloudy Jawes with my fleſh, or a cruell Tyrant rake in my bowels with the teeth of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Irons, or be prickt to death with Needles, or endure all the miſeries that any ingenuous witty Devil can invent, than fall into the angry hands of a loving Saviour. Much rather would I ſee the Sun ſcowle, and all the clouds of Heaven come ratling down in a Tempeſt upon my head, than behold the leaſt frown in the brow of the bleſſed Jeſus. What anger muſt that be which ſhall lye in the boſome of Love? What fire burns like to Jealouſie? Who ſo enraged as thoſe whoſe love is abuſed, and groſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned? All that the Apoſtle can tell us in Anſwer to this Queſtion, is, that <hi>our God is a conſuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12.29. Our God, even the God of Chriſtians, the God of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus, the God of Love and Goodneſs, is a burning, conſuming Fire. And who may dwell with everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:31853:193"/>who may abide when he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry? Leſt any ſhould ſay that the Bloud of Jeſus ſhall quench the flames, and extinguiſh theſe angry heats, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to whom he ſpeaks theſe words; not to men under the Law, from the fiery Mount, but to thoſe who were come to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the bloud of ſprinkling, <hi>&amp;c. v.</hi> 22, 24. from whence he concludes theſe two things:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, That greater puniſhment ſhall be inflicted on Chriſtians than others, if they refuſe obedience to Chriſts commands, <hi>v.</hi> 25.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, That therefore they ſhould ſeriouſly betake themſelves to the ſervice of their Lord, with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and godly fear, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Wicked men conclude, O we ſhall eſcape well enough, take you no care, Chriſt hath died and done all for us. We need not be ſo ſcrupulous ſince he hath ſatisfied for our ſins. But the Apoſtle makes juſt the quite contrary concluſion, <hi>We are come to the Bloud of Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore ſee that you refuſe not him that ſpeaketh,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:31853:194"/>The Bloud of Jeſus ſpeaks better things to thoſe that accept of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and obey it, than the bloud of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>'s ſacrifice did; but to all that refuſe it, it ſpeaks more ſadly than the bloud that cryed againſt <hi>Cain;</hi> and for ever ſhall ſuch men be baniſhed from the face of God.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle you ſee repreſents our God thus terrible after he had moſt highly magnified the priviledge of Chriſtians; and that will apologize for me who have diverted to this ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when I was treating of the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Feaſt of Chriſtians. But to that I ſhall now return again.</p>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:31853:201"/>he calls the <hi>fruits of their lips,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſuch as they had vowed and conſecrated to God, in token of their gratitude. And this place of the Apoſtle ſeems exactly anſwerable to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> 50.14. <hi>Offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God Thanksgiving, and pay thy vowes to the Moſt High.</hi> But then after he had given them this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perform theſe two duties of Thankſgiving and Almes-doing at the Sacrament, he adds <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>But to do good, and communicate, forget not, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, i. e.</hi> Do not think it ſufficient to have payed your vowes at that ſolemn meeting of Chriſtians, but over and above that, you muſt be carefull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe continuall Charity, and not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſeaſon or occaſion of doing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good; and this is a kind of daily ſacrifice wherewith God is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted. As the <hi>Jewes</hi> had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Burnt-offerings, beſide thoſe extraordinary Peace-offerings, when they gave thanks for ſome great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; ſo Chriſtians beſides theſe offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the Table of the Lord, muſt be mindfull daily to be beneficiall unto
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:31853:202"/>others, according as they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects preſented unto them. And that they may not forget, it will be wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to keep themſelves in doing, and preſently after this Divine Food, to think of feeding others that ſtand in need.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us not preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our worldly Employments (if it be not upon the Lords day that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) but let us ſpend the after-part of the day in entertaining our Lord with acts of Love and Delight, with Thanks and Praiſe unto him for his favours. Let us admire his Perfections and Graces; let us talk with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Affairs of our Souls; let us open to him every room in the Houſe, and lead him into the moſt private clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of our hearts, ſhew him all our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, acquaint him with all our wants and weakneſſes, ſpread before him all our deſires, and earneſtly entreat him to ſtay and dwell with us. Let us tell him again, That all we have is his; let us tye a new knot upon the band of the Covenant that is between us; let us be afraid, leſt by going preſently into the world, it ſhould be looſed and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:31853:202"/>It is not fit (you know) that a Bride, on the day ſhe is married, ſhould go from the company of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, to follow Houſhold-buſineſs, or aſſociate her ſelf with other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but ſhe delights only in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her new Love. Even ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly it is to leave the company of our Lord as ſoon as we have let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts, and to divert to other occaſions, when we have newly given him our Faith, and taken him as the Bridegroom of our ſouls. We ſhould paſs that day at leaſt in heavenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with him, in expreſſions of our love and affection toward him, in acts of deſire after inſeparable union with him, and in promiſes and vows that we will alwayes be faithfull and loyal unto him; that ſo the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the day may be as a <hi>Poſtcae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> an lafter-Supper, and ſecond Communion, like the Feaſt of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſucceeded (I told you) in ancient time the holy Sacrament. And indeed it is not only unbecoming us, but likewiſe very dangerous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to our health, when we are thus warm, to ſtep inſtantly into the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:31853:203"/>cold and chilling affairs of this world. <hi>Motibus oppoſitis nihil permitioſius,</hi> is a rule among Phyſicians; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more hurtfull to us, than moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons quite oppoſite, immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding each to other; and therefore as it is pernicious after exerciſe, to go and waſh in cold water; ſo it muſt needs be extreamly noxious to ſink our ſelves into Earthly Employments, juſt after our ſouls have been above in the exerciſe of love to God.</p>
                     <p>It argues likewiſe a ſoul but little affected, that can preſently reliſh Worldly things, after it hath had any taſts of Gods ſweetneſs. It ſeems to me that ſuch a man is like to <hi>Gany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede</hi> the Shepherds Boy, in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who though he was beloved of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and carried up to Heaven, yet could not forget the things that he had left behind, but asks, <hi>What now will become of my Fathers Sheep?</hi> Alas! whither will they wander now that I am taken from them? How will my buſineſs thrive, if I ſpend ſo much time in Meditation and Prayer, ſaith a ſilly ſoul? How ſhall I be caſt behind in my work, while I am thus employed?
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:31853:203"/>But as the <hi>Dialogiſt</hi> handſomely brings in <hi>Jupiter,</hi> giving him a check, ſo may <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And therefore if it be not fit nor ſafe to return preſently to our Secular buſineſs, much leſs can it be tollerable to go to any merry Entertainments or Compotations, though never ſo moderate and innocent.

                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we communicate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lords day, yet let us not take our thoughts off from this Action, but ſpend as much as we can of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day in ſuch exerciſes as I have now named. Let us entertain with the beſt chear we are able to make, our new and beloved Gueſt. Let us commend his beauty, and praiſe him for his kindneſs, and extoll his Riches, and proteſt unto him how much we love him, and crave him pardon for our follies, and deſire him not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the dark and naſty hole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we have brought him, and entreat him of all loves that he will not take exception at his poor enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; and labour to charm him
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:31853:205"/>(as it were) to ſtay with us by all the ſongs of praiſe and thankſgiving that we can deviſe. For to ſay the truth, there is no exerciſe more meet upon the Lords Day, than that of giving thanks, and ſinging Pſalms of Praiſe to God for all his goodneſs to us, as we are his Creatures, and as we are Chriſtians. The day it ſelf is a type of Heaven, and the Eternal Reſt; and therefore our work in it ſhould better accord with what is done in Heaven, where they at every thought indite a Pſalm, and at every breath they chant it forth; and never ceaſe day nor night from bleſſing God. And ſo <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> That they uſed to thank God on their holy times for having made the world, and all things in it for the uſe of man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in his ſecond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology he juſtifies the Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Heathen, from this thing, that they conſumed not Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with fire in ſacrifice, but received them with Prayer and Thankſgiving, for being boin, for all means of health, all kinds of qualities, and changes of ſeaſons, and ſuch like mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:31853:205"/>which we ſhould imitate, not only at the Euchariſt, but afterward, when we may more largely think how much we are beholden to him for his goodneſs. Let us ſay, O my Lord! I have been praiſing of thee, but alas! I have not praiſed thee enough, and therefore I cannot ceaſe to praiſe thee. The birds that chirp in the Air, would ſhame me, if I ſhould not ſtill praiſe thee. For how long do they ſing for a ſip or two of Water, or for a Dinner upon half a Worm, and for a little houſe within a buſh? Shall not I then perſiſt in bleſſing of thee for the viands of Heaven, for a Feaſt on the Body and Bloud of thy Sonne, for the joys of thine own houſe, for a long health, for a pleaſant dwelling, for a plentifull Table, for a world of Creatures that miniſter every day unto me? Better were it that I ſhould be turned into one of thoſe little chearfull Creatures, and that I ſhould take my dwelling in an hedge, than that I ſhould not have a heart to bleſs thee as long as I live, and ſing praiſe to thee as long as I have my being. Awake, awake, O my ſleepy ſoul, and let this day be
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:31853:206"/>more than a ſhadow of Heaven. Yea one day is too ſhort, let every day have ſomething of this in it, and be a good day unto thee. And then ſhall Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be joyfull, and the everlaſting day ſhall give thee light long enough to perfect his praiſes</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As we ſhould ſpend a great deal of the after-part of the day in ſuch acts of praiſe, ſo let ſome of it be ſpent in an <hi>after-examination.</hi> Let us make ſome ſolemn reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our behaviour when we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; and if we find our minds not to have been ſo ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and our hearts not ſo deeply affected as we did deſire: We may caſt down our ſelves humbly at the feet of our Lord, and beg a pardon of our ſweet and loving Saviour, and earneſtly importune him, that he would help us now by an after-act, that we may be able to do that, which we ſhould have done before. Or elſe we may be excited to rejoyce the more in his goodneſs, and to bleſs him for the refreſhments he hath afforded us, and to render him more hearty thanks that he hath ſatisfied us ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:31853:206"/>with the fatneſs of his houſe, and made us to drink of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his pleaſure. But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our ſelves, being a thing that we ſhould exerciſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and was practiſed even by Heathens, before they went to bed, I ſhall ſpare all further diſcourſe about it.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let us ſpend ſome time in <hi>ſtrengthning of our purpoſes,</hi> and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our reſolutions of a more holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that ſo there may be ſome fruit ſeen of this day, in many others that follow, till the ſolemnity ſhall return again. Let us labour to fix and plant the meditations we have had ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our mind, that they may ſhoot their Roots to the bottome of our hearts, &amp; nothing may be able to pluck them up. Let us poſſeſs our hearts ſo much with thoſe perſwaſions, that when a temptation comes and knocks at our door, we may readily and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſay, Ceaſe your importunity, for <hi>Christ dwells here,</hi> and I cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to you, <hi>Ego non ſum ego,</hi> I am not he that I was before, the property of the houſe is quite changed; and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:31853:207"/>though I was, not long ago, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Inne to entertain all comers; yet now I am become the ſole habitation of my Lord. Let us make our ſouls ſo ſenſible that he is in us, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, that we may readily think on every occaſion in this manner. How is it fit that I ſhould treat my gracious Lord, who hath taken his abode within me? Shall I take the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of a Harlot? Shall I over-charge that body with loads of meat and drink, where he hath choſen for to reſide? Shall I force him out of his houſe by any impunities? Shall I offend him by the ſmell of any noiſome breath out of my mouth? Shall I diſpleaſe him by any unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thought? Shall I be ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the World, that I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to retire to converſe with my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saviour? Shall I ſo perplex, my ſelf in buſineſs, as to omit to pray, to meditate, to ſing praiſe to him? No, I am not at my own diſpoſe, <hi>I have ſworn,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.106.</note> 
                        <hi>I will perform it, That I will keep thy righteous Judgements.</hi> And to provoke every one the more to do
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:31853:207"/>his endeavour thus to ſtrengthen his reſolution, let theſe two things be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered. Firſt, The more carefully we walk with God, the leſs labour we ſhall find to prepare our ſelves againſt the next Communion; with the leſs pains ſhall we dreſs up our ſouls to come to another Feaſt. There will be ſome reliſh of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer food left in our hearts, and we ſhall be, though not in the next, yet in no very remote diſpoſition to perform the ſame acts again. Secondly, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry return to finne after theſe Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, makes it more intollerable, and more highly diſpleaſing to God and our Saviour. After a man hath ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered how hatefull it is in its own nature, after he hath reſolved againſt it, and ſolemnly covenanted to avoid it, the ſinne is more black and deadly, a greater wrong to him that we have taken to lodge in our ſouls, than <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and the <hi>Scribes</hi> did him, when they put him to death. If this truth were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon mens hearts, ſinne would find colder entertainment with them, than it doth, and they would not have
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:31853:208"/>ſuch kindneſs for that which faſtens a more odious Character upon them, than they can put on the very worſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the murtherers of our Lord. And yet I ſhall more than ſay, that ſinners now do greater injury to him, than did the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> if you will but grant this one Principle, which is clearly proved by one of our own Writers.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>The Rule whereby we muſt meaſure the greatneſs of a wrong done, is the oppoſition which it hath in it, to the Will of him that is wronged.</hi> And ſo the more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite any act or practiſe is to the will or liking of the party that is diſpleaſed and wronged, the greater are we to account the injury and offence which is done to him. Now all men that live in ſin, and eſpecially thoſe who lick up their vomit after they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, do thoſe things which Chriſt is more unwilling they ſhould do, than he was to ſuffer all the indignities of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and all the torments that the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws could inflict. He was willing to dye by their hands, rather than inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience ſhould fall upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:31853:208"/>ſinne ſhould reign over us, and Satan keep poſſeſſion in us. He was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that this ſhould be our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he rather chuſed to dye, that he might caſt the Devil out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all his works, and reſtore us to liberty again. Now if any man hold on Satans ſide, and ſeek to keep him in his Throne, if any will maintain and uphold his Works, and ſtand in the defence of his Cauſe, he doth a thing more diſpleaſing and grievous unto Chriſt, than his Death and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was. He was not troubled ſo much to dye, as he is to ſee thee live in ſin; for he dyed that thou mighteſt ceaſe to ſin. And therefore have a care what thou doſt, unleſs thou wilt be worſe than a <hi>Jew,</hi> and wound him more than he did who lanced his ſide; and be a greater and more dangerous Enemy to him, than they that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted his death. And conſider, if ſin be ſo diſpleaſing to him, ſo much againſt his will, that he was willing to ſuffer any torment, rather than it ſhould live; how canſt thou think that he will ſtay with thee, if thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain offendeſt him, and makeſt no
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:31853:209"/>conſcience to watch over thy wayes, and avoid all temptations, and ſhun all occaſions of ſinne? How can he endure thou ſhouldſt lodge Harlots to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him? That thou ſhouldſt let this world in, to be his Compeere, and divide thy heart with him? No, he is the High and holy One, he expects to be treated honourably, and like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf; that we ſhould keep the houſe clean and ſweet, that we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly and godlily: And then as he hath come to us, ſo he will abide with us, and will manifeſt himſelf to our ſouls, acquaint us with more of the ſecrets of his Religion, and the delights that are in his holy life. For ſo he ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf unto him;</hi> which he repeats over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, verſe 23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words: And my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> I ſpeak the more of this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

When we cannot outwardly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, yet we may in heart, in ſpirit. Though we cannot alwayes celebrate the myſteries, yet we may have the thing ſignified in thoſe myſteries (as
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:31853:214"/>St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks) at all times, in all places. <hi>i. e.</hi> We may with pious affections and holy actions receive Chriſt continually into our ſouls. As the Sacrament (ſaith he) <hi>ſine re Sacramenti, without the thing of the Sacrament</hi> is death to the unworthy; ſo we may conclude that <hi>res Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, the thing it ſelf without the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> will be life eternal to the worthy. Whenſoever in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt thou art piouſly and devoutly affected into an imitation of Chriſt, thou doſt eat his Body, and drink his Blood. But then if we do conſtantly preſerve ſuch longings and hungring after this Feaſt, and do at all times feaſt upon him; we cannot paſs by any occaſion that God affords us of receiving him in that manner that he hath appointed and bleſſed; and we cannot but be very forward to go to remember him when opportunity is preſented in the Aſſembly of his people. And therefore I ſhall not make it a diſtinct advice, that you would come again when this Table is ſpread for you. For this is but a juſt gratitude to God, a ſign that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:31853:215"/>we like his fare, and are well pleaſed with his chear, and are ambitious of nothing more than ſuch an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I think we ſhall ſhew our ſelves to have been very unworthy gueſts at the laſt Feaſt, if we like it ſo little as to refuſe to come the next time that we are invited.

Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a great devotion, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of ſpirit, when the holy Ghoſt like fire had deſcended upon them. And this heat did not abate in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the ſpace of 400 years, but in ſome Churches of <hi>Affrica</hi> (as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> writes) and in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> (as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> tells us) they retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ardent love, and continually remembred the dying of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:31853:216"/>great part from this ſpring, that they received ſo frequently the Body and Blood of our Lord. Hence we may derive their ſtrength, activeneſs, and zeal; becauſe they were ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with this Wine. This gave them boldneſs againſt their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; this made them run ſo forwardly into flames, becauſe they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly heated with divine fires. From this Table they went away with the courage of Lions, and were terrible even to that great roaring Lion which devours ſo many careleſs ſouls. He could not make ſuch an eaſie prey of them as he doth of us, becauſe they did daily renew their ſtrength by this food, and became as bold as a Lion, after he hath eaten fleſh and drunken blood.</p>
                     <p>And if we did more frequently Communicate, it would be a means to bring us to a greater reſemblance of our Lord (which was the thing that I laſt preſſed) who you know over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the evil one, and trod him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet.

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:31853:216"/>white, becauſe they neither ſee nor eat any thing but driven Snow; ſo by often adorning and eating beauty, goodneſs, and purity it ſelf in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sacrament, we ſhould become altogether vertuous, pure and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull.

                     <p n="8">VIII. Eighthly, Let us be ſure to live in charity with our Brethren, to which we are in a ſpecial manner engaged by this Sacrament, and of which we make a moſt ſolemn profeſſion. Let us behave our ſelves as Servants in the ſame family, as ſons of the ſame father, as thoſe who have eaten of the ſame bread. Let us be very carefull that we do not cover the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:31853:217"/>coals of anger and contention under the aſhes for a night, and then blow them up again the next morning, but let us quite extinguiſh them, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly put them out. Let not your jealouſies, your hard thoughts, your uncharitable and raſh cenſurings, your differences and enmities ever return again; but let that ſentence run in your minds, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.11. <hi>Beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought to love one another.</hi> If he have given his Son; if he ſtill give him to us; if we feed and live upon him, then let us love as Brethren, and not fall out in our way to Heaven. And if we find our love to grow ſick and weak, and to be fallen to decay, then let us come hither on purpoſe for to revive it, and raiſe it up again. If the Lamp begin to burn dim, and to caſt a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak light, let us pour in more Oyl that it may not go out. If our love begin to be chill and cold, let us put this fire the oftner under it, that it may be kept in a flame. For aſſure your ſelves, that they who take up their differences and enmities again, did never truly lay them aſide; they
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:31853:217"/>did but mock God when they came to this holy Communion with a pretence of Love and Charity, their hearts not being throughly reſolved to forget all in juries and offences. Or if they did ſeriouſly labour to put to death all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, one great reaſon why they are not throughly mortified, is, becauſe they uſe ſo rarely this powerfull means of ſuppreſſing them, and keeping them in their graves. Men do one with another,<note place="margin">Plutarch &amp; alij.</note> as the <hi>Theſpien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> with married perſons, who once in <hi>five years ſpace,</hi> kept a Feaſt called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, in <hi>Cupids</hi> honour, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of all differences that had happened between Man and Wife. Such a ſmall Feſtivity do men make of this Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to which they come perhaps with an intention to bury all differences; but then they give them a whole twelve moneths time, if not more, to revive and gather ſtrength again. Hence it is that the temper of the Chriſtian World is as much different from the Spirit of the elder times, as heat is from cold, or life from death. They held ſuch frequent Communions,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:31853:218"/>that their love was ſo flagrant as to make them dye for one another; and we hold them ſo ſeldome, that the heat of our unmortified paſſions makes us wound and kill each other. So that I make account there is but a little difference between <hi>doing this</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and not doing it at all; yea, thoſe enmities will be more fierce and untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, which even the Bloud of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath not quenched.</p>
                     <p>To put a concluſion then to this Diſcourſe, let me adviſe you, when you come from the Table of the Lord, thus to meditate within your ſelves: I have received freſh Pledges of the love of my Lord, and I have made new profeſſions of my own; What now doth the Lord require of me? What have I that I can render back to him? Alas! I have nothing to give him, but only my <hi>love;</hi> nothing but my <hi>love</hi> did I ſay? Oh how great a thing is <hi>love!</hi> how much is incloſed in the boſome of <hi>love!</hi> It is no ſuch trifle as I imagine. <hi>Love</hi> brought God down to us, and <hi>love</hi> will carry us up to God. <hi>Love</hi> made God like to man; and <hi>love</hi> will make men
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:31853:218"/>like to God. <hi>Love</hi> made him dye for us, and <hi>love</hi> will make us lay down our lives for the Brethren. O the power of Heavenly <hi>Love!</hi> How ſhall I get thee planted in my heart? Who can bring thee into my ſoul, but only <hi>love? Love</hi> begets love; and the frequent Meditation of this love of God, and of his Son, will inflame thy heart in love to them. Oh let a ſenſe of this love lye perpetually in my breaſt, that may change me into love. Let me burn and languiſh in the Armes of Jeſus. Let me long for nothing but him; let him be all my talk, all my joy, the Crown of my delight. Let me never forget how gracious he is; let the taſte of his incomparable ſweetneſs be never out of my mouth; let me never rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any thing but what hath ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:31853:219"/>and ſo coldly. Did he think that thoſe whom he loves ſo much, would need ſo much entreaty to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him? Is it not a grief unto him now (if he be capable of any) to ſee that he hath ſo few <hi>Lovers?</hi> Doth it not trouble him, that they who profeſs love to him, teſtifie it ſo poorly and rarely? Nay rather, O my ſoul! he is troubled that we love our ſelves no better; and therefore both for the love of him, and the love of our ſelves, let us carefully obſerve his commands, of which this is one, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>

                  <p>SUch is the nature of all bodies, that the nearer they approach to their proper place and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the more they accelerate their motion, and with the greater ſpeed they run, as if they deſired to be at their beloved reſt, from whence they are loath to be removed. And ſuch is the temper of all holy hearts when they run towards God, the moſt natural place of their reſt, the very Center of their quiet and peace; the nearer they come to him, the faſter they move; they rather <hi>flye</hi> than run; and uſe their Wings ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their feet, out of a vehement
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:31853:220"/>longing to be embraced by him. We cannot but think then, that they who draw nigh to God in this near way of Communion, and are entertained by him at his own Table, do flye up even unto Heaven, and get into his very boſome, as thoſe that ſuffer more ſtrong and powerful attractions from his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Goodneſs. And there my Diſcourſe may well leave them repoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his Arms, and taking their reſt in his love, from whence they will not eaſily endure a divulſion by the force of any other thing. But as a ſtone is unwilling to ſtir from the reſt that it enjoyes in the boſome of the earth; ſo hard will it be to draw ſuch ſouls by the love of other things, from their own Center, where they feel ſo much quiet and tranquillity. Such perſons I might well leave to tell themſelves (and others if they can) what joy they find in God, what ſweetneſs grows on this Tree of Life, and what pleaſures he hath welcomed them withall at this holy Feaſt. Have you ſeen the Sun and the Moon in their full ſtand one againſt the other? Have you beheld a River running with a mighty ſtream
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:31853:221"/>into the Ocean? Or can you think that you ſee the fire falling from Heaven, as it did in <hi>Elias</hi> his time, to conſume a ſacrifice? Theſe are but little reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of that light wherewith their ſouls are filled when they look upon him, of that fulneſs of joy wherein they are abſorpt when their affections run to him, of the teſtimonies that he gives of his acceptance when they offer themſelves to his ſervice. And they themſelves (as I ſaid) can beſt tell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what a Paradiſe of pleaſure he leads them, when he comes into his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and beholds there all pleaſant fruits.</p>
                  <p>But yet for the ſake of thoſe who are ſtrangers to the Divine Life, and are loath to leave their ſinnes, though it be to have Communion with God; I ſhall labour briefly to declare the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of this holy Sacrament, that ſo I may invite them for to lay aſide their ſinnes, and exchange them for better pleaſures. And I hope I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke ſome to hunger after the Houſe of God, and eſpecially after his Table, where he ſeeds the hungry with rare delights; where he cures the wounded,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:31853:221"/>comforts the weak, enlightens the blind, revives the dead, pardons the ſinner, and ſtrengthens him againſt his ſinne. Where he dignifies our ſouls, and deifies, as it were, all our faculties, where he unites us to himſelf, and joyns us in friendſhip with our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, where he ſprinkles our hearts with his Bloud, repleniſheth them with his Grace, refreſheth them with his Love, encourageth them in his wayes, inebriates them with his ſweetneſs, and gives them to drink of the Wine of the Kingdome, and ſowes in them the ſeed of immortality.</p>
                  <p>One would think there ſhould not be a man of ordinary diſcretion that would refuſe to be amended, and ſo much bettered in his condition by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God. For you ſee men tip up the bowels of the earth, and torment her, to make her confeſs her Treaſures; they digg even into the heart of craggy Rocks, and take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible pains for Silver and Gold; they will break their ſweeteſt ſleep to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh an ambitious deſire; they will ſpend their Patrimony, their Credit, their Bodies, and their very Souls for
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:31853:222"/>a drop of drunken pleaſure, or carnal delight. What is the matter then that men cannot be content to ſpend a few earneſt thoughts, to uſe a little ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diligence for the purchaſe of the riches of Heaven and Earth, for the promiſes of this life, and that which is to come, for the glory of God, for a Dignity not inferior to Angels, for a Sea of delights and pleaſures that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh the heart of God? Poor ſouls! they are ignorant ſure of the happineſs that our Lord calls them unto; they imagine there is nothing better than to eat and drink, and ſatiate the body with that which tickleth its ſenſes; they are ſunk into a ſad puddle of filthy imaginations; let us ſee if we can lift up their heads, let us try to open their eyes, let us endeavour to perſwade that there are diviner delights, that there is a bread infinitely more delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and a Cup flowing with far more ſweetneſs than that which the World bewitches and inchants her followers withall.<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.8.</note>

The things that are here ſet before us, are, 1. Moſt ſweet, pleaſant and refreſhing. 2. They are ſolid, ſtrengthning and nouriſhing: and 3. They are Medicinal and Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Firſt,<note place="margin">Delicioſa ad ſaporem.</note> To a well-prepared pallate they afford a moſt ſweet and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reliſh. This holy Sacrament breeds a Divine pleaſure, an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Joy in a right tempered ſoul, and overflowes it with ſweetneſs more than the body is ſatisfied with marrow and fatneſs; now this refreſhment ariſes,</p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:31853:225"/>
                  <p n="1">1. From a great ſenſe which is here given us of the love of Chriſt, which (as the ſong of ſongs ſaith) <hi>is better than Wine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 1.2.</note> It is more chearing and exhilerating, more cordial and revive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to think of his dear love in ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Bloud for us, than to drink the bloud of the richeſt Grape; and therefore the Church ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>We will be glad and rejoyce in thee; we will remember thy love more than Wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is beyond a raviſhment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that men are ſo beloved by the King of Heaven, ſo embraced by the Lord of all the world, and ſtill it is the more tranſporting for to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they feed upon this Lord of Love, and that he gives his very ſelf unto them, and by ſuch ſecret and wonderfull wayes unites himſelf unto their ſouls. And it is moſt of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, and but a little below Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to think that this is our Jeſus, and our Lord; to ſay as the Spouſe in the ſame Book, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2.16.</note> When God thus lifts up the light of his countenance upon a ſoul, he puts gladneſs in its heart, more than the joy of Harveſt. This
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:31853:225"/>is a Marriage-Feaſt, and therefore full of pleaſure. Here the ſoul embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him, and he folds it in his arms; here they plight their truth mutually each to other; here they engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in unſeparable unions, to hold perpetuall entercourſe, and live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally together in the greateſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As the Bridegroom rejoyceth over his Bride, ſo the Lord rejoyceth over it, and he ſpeaks not to it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his ſervants, but he kiſſes it with the kiſſes of his own mouth. So one of the Greek Commentators prettily gloſſes upon thoſe words: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Let me not only be eſpouſed to him (ſaith the Church) by his Prophets and Embaſſadors, but let him come himſelf, and converſe with me. <hi>Rebeccah</hi> went along with <hi>Eliezer</hi> before ſhe knew <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and was reſolved to be his Wife before he ſpake with her himſelf; but at laſt ſhe beheld him, to whom ſhe travelled, and came into his Arms whoſe love ſhe ſought, and then was her joy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. Even ſo the Meſſengers of God become Suitors to us in the Name
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:31853:226"/>of Chriſt, and wooe our affections to be eſpouſed to him, giving us many tokens of his love: And when we conſent and reſolve to be his, then by their Miniſtry we are conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his arms, and at this Marriage Feaſt we receive the fulleſt joyes that flow from his heart unto us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It flowes from a ſenſe of the pleaſures that are in the exerciſe of true Religion. That is the greateſt delight which ariſes from the fouls own proper acts, and which it feels not only within, but from it ſelf. And the more noble any of its acts are, the more ſatisfying the objects are on which they are placed, the higher will the contentment be which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. As much therefore, as acts of piety do ſurpaſs all other, ſo much will the delight which accompanies them, go beyond all other delights. And as theſe acts of Devotion, which are performed by the worthy Receiver at this holy Communion, are tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all other Religious Acts; ſo will the feeling of them be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond all other pleaſurable moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſoul. It is a rare delight to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:31853:226"/>put forth Acts of Faith and Love, Thankſgiving and Rejoycing; and here all theſe Acts are in their top and height; and the ſoul exerts its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt force, and ſtrains it ſelf to do its beſt. Yea, here muſt needs be the greateſt ſweetneſs and delight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe part of our duty is joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and we do very ill, if then we do not rejoyce. And there is none knows but he that feels it, how pleaſant it is likewiſe to mourn for ſinne, and to be wounded with a ſenſe of our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as well as of his love. There is ſweetneſs in thoſe tears which drop from a heart full of love; that ſorrow is delightfull which ſprings from the ſenſe of a kindneſs. Here holy ſouls begin to feel the truth of what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Matth 5.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> It is part of their comfort, that they can mourn and ſhed a tear over a ſick ſoul, and a bleeding Saviour. What comfort then is there (think you) in the ſenſe of a pardon, if there be ſuch comfort in mourning for the offence? If tears be ſuch pleaſant food, then what are ſongs and praiſes?</p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:31853:227"/>
                  <p n="3">3. From the hope of Heaven, and the expectation of the eternal Supper, to which this is but a preparatory En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. This is ſome fore-taſt to ſtay our longings, and yet to excite our deſires after the Heavenly Feaſt above. Here we break our faſt (as I may ſay) but are made thereby very hungry, till that great Supper come. Here we have but a praelibation, a little ſhort antepaſt of ſome rare things to come; yet ſeeing it is an earneſt of thoſe things, it creates in a holy ſoul a wonderfull contentment both from its own ſweetneſs, and the hopes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it feeds us. It nouriſhes, I ſay, in us moſt delicious longings; it makes the ſoul even ſwell with comfortable expectations; and we receive it not only as a remembrance of what was done, but as a pledge of what ſhall be. We taſte not only what he is to our ſouls at preſent, but what he will be for ever.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it is a great part of the pleaſure of this food, that it hath ſo many taſts, and affords us ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reliſhes. In it we taſte his love in dying, his love now that he is in the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:31853:227"/>Heavens, and his love when he ſhall appear in his glory. We taſte of the fruit of his death, and of the fruit of his Reſurrection alſo, yea and of his coming again to raiſe us from the dead too. We feel what he did upon the Croſs; and that which was bitter to him, is ſweet to us. We feel what he doth for us now in the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his Spirit makes us taſte the pleaſures of Devotion in our hearts. And we begin likewiſe to feel what he will do for us when he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And how pleaſant muſt it be to a ſoul to have all this Cheer? how delightfull to think that Chriſt dwells in us, and we in him? (<hi>John</hi> 6.65.) How ſweet to read that we ſhall have eternal life by union with him? (<hi>v.</hi> 55.) And how joyfull muſt they be who carry about with them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally this hope of Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From a ſenſe how well pleaſed our Saviour is with the love of holy ſouls. He not only communicates himſelf to us in this Sacrament, but hath alſo a kind of Communion with
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:31853:228"/>us. He delights to behold our grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and gladſome remembrance of him; to behold our love to him, and our love to each other. It pleaſes him to ſee his people flock together with a greedineſs to receive him, and forwardneſs to tye themſelves more dearly to him. And therefore he is pleaſed to uſe ſuch words to his Spouſe as ſhe doth to him: She had ſaid, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Thy love is better than Wine:</hi> And he ſaith the ſame, only with a greater extaſie of Affection, cap. 4.10. <hi>How much better is thy love than Wine!</hi> And this Book ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men (the Fathers of the Church) have interpreted of the ſpiritual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between Chriſt and his Church, which is in this Sacrament both repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and confirmed. Now what pleaſure hence ariſes to the ſoul, when it thinks that its Beloved is pleaſed, and that it rejoyces the heart of Chriſt, every one may know that can love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>It is the contentment of their love that it is accepted; and a great recompenſe that it is kindly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is enough (though briefly)
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:31853:228"/>ſaid to invite any Voluptuary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſpirituall man: He muſt have a great deal of the Swine in him, that cannot be tempted by the delights of this Heavenly Food, which offers it ſelf to his taſte. Here a man ſhall be ſatisfied with the love of Chriſt, with the pleaſures of all Religious acts, with the hope of Heaven, which is the Celeſtiall Manna, with a ſenſe of the joy in Heaven on our behalf. He hath forgotten ſure the pleaſures of a man, whoſe ſoul is not greedy to be filled with theſe things. It is part of the puniſhment of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to loſe the rareſt delights here, as well as to ſuffer eternal pains hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly:</hi>

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:31853:229"/>there they lay the foundation of a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy, by turning the affections of the heart toward Chriſt. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of this food are not like a blaze of ſtraw, that warms a man for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but ſoon leaves him cold; nor like a flaſh of Lightning, darting through the ſoul for a moment, which returns preſently into its darkneſs; nor like the frisking of the ſpirits in our body after a draught of Wine, which when the adventitious heat is over, fall into ſluggiſhneſs again: But they are ſolid and ſubſtantial, like to the warmths of the Sun-beams when there is no Clouds before his face, nor no windes to ſweep them away; or rather like the pleaſures of eating food, which encreaſes our ſtrength, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens our bones, and cauſes a durable chearfulneſs and vivacity of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. For Bread, you know, is called the ſtaffe of Life, and that which ſtrengthens mans heart; as Wine is that which glads his heart, and cheareth God and Man.</p>
                  <p>By a right uſe of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all the faculties and parts of the ſoul are nouriſhed and augmented:
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:31853:229"/>The underſtanding becomes more full and clear in its perceptions; the will is made more free and chearfull in its choice of good; the affections more Heavenly and Divine, more forward and compliant with our wills, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions more regular and orderly, under better government and command. All which would admit of a large diſcourſe; but ſeeing I have drawn this tract al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to over-great a length, I will chuſe to ſpeak (and that but briefly neither) of what is moſt ſenſible to every good man, <hi>viz.</hi> the encreaſe of theſe three great Graces, <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith</hi> is hereby made more ſolid and ſtrong, whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in its direct, or reflex acts: <hi>i. e.</hi> We do in this holy Feaſt look moſt ſeriouſly upon the proper object of our Faith, Jeſus Chriſt, and all the truths of the Goſpel. We do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with all our ſouls to embrace a crucified Saviour; We do ſeal to this truth which he hath ſealed by his Bloud; We make a moſt ſolemn and publick confeſſion of what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: We do moſt ſacredly proteſt
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:31853:230"/>that we firmly conſent to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, and obey it. And then if we would reflect and turn our eyes back into our own ſouls, and believe ſomething of our ſelves, we may be able to make a better judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſelves, and be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the belief that we are real Chriſtians, ſeeing after ſerious exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and advice with our ſelves, we find that we heartily love and obey Chriſts commands, and ſeeing that in his moſt ſacred Preſence who is the ſearcher of the heart, we dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently avow it, that there is not any thing, though never ſo difficult, which we know to be his Will, but we are reſolved for to do it. We are then in the right uſe of this Food, more ſtrengthned both in the premiſſes, and alſo in the concluſion. As if a man ſhould make this Syllogiſm or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, He that heartily believes in Chriſt, and obeys the Goſpel-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſhall inherit the promiſes, and be ſaved; I do ſo heartily believe and obey, Therefore I ſhall be ſaved. All theſe three Propoſitions or Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, are by worthy receiving,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:31853:230"/>much ſtrengthened in us. We do heartily profeſs to believe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and we are more confirmed in our belief, and in particular of this, That he who doth believe in Chriſt, and obey him, ſhall be ſaved. We ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes ſuch teſtimonies of Gods love, that we cannot but be full of this belief, which is a generall Faith, and contained in the firſt of thoſe now named Propoſitions. We do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe here renew our conſent to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey our Lord in every thing he hath ſaid; and this contains the ſecond Propoſition, and is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſpecial act of Faith. Now what ſhould hinder, but that we may conclude moſt ſtrongly that which is in the Third, <hi>Therefore I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> And then Faith is manifeſtly nouriſhed in every ſenſe that you can take it in; We do directly put forth more lively acts of Faith, as that implies aſſenting to the Goſpel, and conſenting to obey it. And why ſhould not the conſequent be, That we may reflect more comfortably and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly upon our ſelves, that we are in a ſafe condition. And that we may
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:31853:231"/>continue ſo, there wants nothing but that we be diligent in the uſe of all means, of which this is one, To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and eſtabliſh our faith more by often receiving the Sacred Body and Bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Hope</hi> is here alſo nouriſhed and made more lively. And indeed it muſt be ſtrengthned in proportion to our Faith, for hope ariſes out of it, and hath its growth with it, being but the expectation and waiting of Faith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I believe thoſe things that are promiſed in the Goſpel, therefore I wait for them; the ſtronger therefore that my belief and obedience is, the ſtronger will my hope be. Now he that expreſſes his Faith in Chriſt at this Sacrament, and believes alſo that Chriſt is really preſent there, and likewiſe that he is united to Chriſt through a worthy uſe of it; He doth thereby get a greater reaſon to hope and wait for the other appearance and preſence of Chriſt more viſibly and openly, when he ſhall be diveſted of all ſigns and figures, and ſhall reveal himſelf with open face: When we ſhall not know him ſo much as that he
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:31853:231"/>dyed, but as he that lives, and reigns, and triumphs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our <hi>Love</hi> hereby is manifeſtly enlarged and nouriſhed, partly by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling one of Chriſts commands. He that loves me, keeps my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (ſaith our Lord) and this is one of them, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> And partly by laying new fewel upon the fire which it may feed upon. New conſiderations (I mean) and experiences, new arguments and incentives to obedience. And partly by knitting and uniting of us in a more cordial love and affection to all our Brethren, which is an expreſſion of love to him. For he hath ſaid, 1 John 4.12. <hi>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> what will not they do, what cannot they overcome? All the craft of the Devil is diſcovered, all his power is broken, all his temptations are baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this Heavenly Nouriſhment. For if we conſider the <hi>firſt</hi> piece of the Devils Policy, which conſiſts in magnifying and extolling the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:31853:232"/>of that thing to which he would tempt us; it is defeated by the <hi>light of faith</hi> which this Sacrament doth make more clear and ſhining. He uſes all the Rhetorick and Sophiſtry that he hath, to perſwade us that it is a harmleſs, or a pleaſant, or a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or a credible thing. He paints ſinne forth in the beſt colours, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for it the moſt amorous dreſſes. And as you ſee a Mountebank com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his Medicines, his Balſomes, and Pomanders with ſo many amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and lyes, and arts of inſinuation, that he cheats poor ſilly people: So doth the Devil puff up the ambitious mans mind, and ſwells a Mole-hill into a Mountain; and he tickles the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton fancy with promiſes of raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an empty pleaſure; and to the covetous heart, he ſaith, Thou canſt not tell the contentment that ſo many baggs of Gold, or ſuch a fair Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would give thy heart: And there is no man but he labours to caſt a miſt before his eyes, and to dazzle him with ſome glittering appearance, in the midſt of which he hopes to work his ends upon him. Now the light
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:31853:232"/>of faith ſtrikes through all thoſe paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhows; and an hearty belief of the truth of the Goſpel (which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Euchariſt ſtill encreaſeth) makes all theſe ſhadows flye away. It will not let us be deceived, as was our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eve,</hi> with ſpecious pretences; but ſaith, <hi>Avant</hi> thou Impoſtor; away, you lying vanities; Tell me not theſe Tales; <hi>For his Teſtimonies have I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as an Heritage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.111. And there is no leſs power in this holy food, to enervate a <hi>ſecond</hi> of his Arts, which is to affright us with the noiſe of danger and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that ſhall ſeem greater than all the pleaſures of goodneſs, if we will not be perſwaded but that it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable. He puts ſtrange vizards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all things, and makes them look as ugly and fouly as he can, that ſo he may make us flye from the troubles of a mortified life. He labours to make us believe that there is nothing but ſadneſs in Gods wayes, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins perhaps to make us melancholly with the very thoughts of it. And if this will not do, he will ſtir up enes
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:31853:233"/>mies againſt us, to diſcourage us, our own friends perhaps ſhall caſt us off, or the fire of perſecution ſhall burn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. But now the <hi>Hope</hi> of the glory of God will make us rejoyce even in the midſt of tribulations. Here we embrace alſo a crucified Saviour; and there is no better Livery, than a Garment rent and torn, a Body wounded and abuſed (if need ſhould be) for Chriſts ſake. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can affright a ſoul that dwells in the wounds of its Saviour, as in the holes of a Rock. Nothing will ſeem difficult to a heart that is filled with expectations, to dwell for ever in his embraces in the Heavens. And now how is the world and the fleſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded when they ſee good men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and triumph in the midſt of all miſeries and diſcouragements? How do the Devils howle to ſee their ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems ſo unſucceſsfull, that even Paines are accounted Pleaſures, and Loſſes are accounted Gains, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are turned into Joyes, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are the Gate-houſes of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes?</p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:31853:233"/>
                  <p>The Devil, you will ſay, will ſtudy to be revenged on ſuch men, and will not ceaſe to vent his malice againſt ſuch ſouls. And ſeeing he knows not how to do them harm but by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them ſin, he will try if like a Serpent he can inſinuate but a part of himſelf at any little hole. He will perſwade them to ſelf-indulgence in ſome ſmall crime, that ſo he may bring them to all the reſt; or he will labour to draw them, if it may be, within the verge of ſin, into an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions place, into the ſociety of a temptation, hoping that by little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and preambles, he may make way for ſin to enter. But the <hi>love of God,</hi> which is here much inflamed, will make the ſoul of ſuch a quick ſcent that it may eaſily perceive his wiles. Love doth extraordinarily enlighten the ſoul by its flames, and will make it more diſcerning of the leaſt ſpot that is in it ſelf, and of the leaſt danger that is without. And the more pure and white the ſoul grows by <hi>love,</hi> the ſooner will any ſpeck of filth be eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it. The more full of light it is, the more imperfections will it take
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:31853:234"/>notice of, which before were unobſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as in the beams of the Sun we ſee a thouſand little attomes or motes which before were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned.</p>
                  <p>By all this, which in your own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation may be enlarged, you ſee what ſtrength it affords. To which you may add, if you pleaſe, that as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath baits for every pallate, and can humour every mans taſte, and comply with all complexions and diſpoſitions: So is the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an Heavenly Manna which taſtes as every man wiſhes, and (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book of Wiſdom ſpeaks) <hi>doth ſerve to the appetite of the eater,</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">I fficacia ad medicinam.</note> But this Bread and Wine being ſpiritually received, are not onely <hi>food and meat, but Phyſick and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine alſo.</hi> They are means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve health where it is, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it where it is decayed. Though this may ſeem more doubtfull then the two former, and you may ask
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:31853:234"/>how Bread-and-Wine do ſignifie any thing of this nature; yet I ſhall ſhow you that is denoted by them in Chriſts intention, more then any thing elſe. For the bread (as you have ſeen) doth not repreſent the Body and fleſh of Chriſt barely and in general, as it is the food of the ſoul, but in a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial manner, as the fleſh of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and that a Sacrifice for our ſin, whereby it becomes not only our <hi>meat,</hi> but our <hi>medicine</hi> alſo. The food we eat is in remembrance that Chriſt died for ſin, and ſo it is healing to our ſouls, and killing to our ſins; it purges away our iniquities, and purifies our hearts. And ſo Chriſts Blood is here conſidered as the Blood of the Croſs, the Blood of Atonement and propitiation for us; and therefore we do not receive (as hath been ſaid) bare Bread and Wine, but Bread bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and Wine poured out. And here you may take notice of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Chriſt did inſtitute Bread and Wine, rather then fleſh, to repreſent himſelf by, unto us. Not becauſe fleſh was uſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Sacrifices, for ſo were Bread and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:31853:235"/>Wine: nor onely becauſe this was the common food and nouriſhment for the body, for ſo was fleſh alſo: But it is likely Chriſt chooſes things without life, wherein there was no Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> Bread and Wine, becauſe he would ſhew that no Creature was any more to loſe its life for the ſin of men, and that no more Bloud was to be ſhed for expiation of it. The Paſſeover, which we may call a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Old Teſtament, was blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to denote Chriſts Bloud that ſhould be ſhed; but now that it is ſhed, the Sacrament, which repreſents it as already done, is without any bloudy thing. He is ſhown to us as one that hath died by this broken bread and wine effuſed; and he ſhows us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that there ſhall be no more Death, no more blood ſhed for us (a full A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement being made) becauſe it is onely bread, and onely Wine. Theſe things then having ſuch a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Chriſts Death, the worthy receiving of them muſt needs be of great force.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As an Antidote to take away the poyſon and killing-power of ſin.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:31853:235"/>The Blood of Chriſt doth waſh away our guilt, and takes off all obligation unto puniſhment; and the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Chriſt hath died for us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the poyſon from the heart which would make us faint and die. It heals the wounds that ſin hath made, and takes away the anger of the ſore; it aſſwages the rage and heat of that ſting which the fiery Serpent had ſent unto us, and ſuffers not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome to undo us. The pardon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is granted to us by vertue of the Covenant of grace, when we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly repent and believe, <hi>i. e.</hi> when we are converted unto God; but now likewiſe it is further ſealed to ſuch perſons. That which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before by the Blood of Chriſt, is now in a ſenſible manner applied to us, and ratified by the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Blood. In the uſe of theſe things likewiſe we receive an increaſe of Piety, and get more full victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over our ſins; and thereby feel more the virtue of the Antidote, and have a ſenſe of our pardon made, as lively as if there was a new act of grace paſſed to ſettle it more ſurely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:31853:236"/>
                  <p n="2">2. It is of a Cathartical virtue alſo, and hath in it a force to purge and cleanſe our ſouls from their impurities. As it takes away the killing-power of ſin againſt us, ſo it kills ſin in us. By our abiding in the Wounds of Chriſt, ſin is wounded and ſlain. If any of you (ſaith St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) do not feel ſo frequently the ſharp motions of anger, envy or luxury, <hi>&amp;c Gratias a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat corpori &amp; ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Art thou affraid of growing cold and dead in good duties? Thou drinkeſt of Jeſus that is full of ſpirit, and will warm and enliven thy heart. Whatſoever ſin thou haſt unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, bring it hither, and nail it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Croſs of Chriſt till it be ſtark dead. And unto whatſoever good thou wouldſt be animated, ſhew thy Lord thy deſire to it, and ſhew him his bloud to move him to beſtow it. Onely remember that it works not as Phyſick doth in a natural, but in a ſpiritual manner. It works as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and requires thy inward, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and ſpiritual operations, and then thou wilt find the profit of it to be greater then all that I have ſaid.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:31853:237"/>Some of the old. Heathen repreſented plenty and worldly happineſs, by a man with bread in one hand, and a Cup in the other, and a Crown of Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py about his head, which ſignified ſleep and emptineſs of care and trouble in the midſt of abundance. That man thou maiſt be; for by this bread and Wine is exhibited to thee all plenty of grace and bleſſing, of peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Thou maiſt lay down thy ſelf in peace, and ſleep quietly; not in the lap of the world and carnal ſecurity, but in the boſome of our Lord, fola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thy ſelf in his love, and ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, more than in the time that their Corn and Wine encreaſed,</hi> Pſal. 4.7.</p>
                  <p>Let me ſay therefore to every holy and well-diſpoſed Soul in the words of St. <hi>Ambroſe, Venias, venias ad cibum Chriſti, adcibum,</hi> &amp;c. Come, come to the food of Chriſt, to the food of the Lords Body, to the banquet of the Sacrament, to the Cup wherewith the affections of the faithfull are inebriated and made drunken; That thou maiſt put off the cares of the world, the ſnares of the Devil, and the fears of

                  <p>AS the Sun and the ſhowres make thoſe Plants more tall and beautifull which have any living roots in the earth, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary do putrifie and dry up thoſe whoſe roots are dead: So it is with this Sacrament, which renders their ſouls more fair and flouriſhing who receive it rooted in love; but thoſe are more dried and hardned by it, and tend more to corruption, who have no life at all in them whereby to convert it into their nouriſhment. Or as you ſee it is in corporal nutriment, thoſe meats which give a plentifull increaſe to ſound bodies, do more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and infeeble thoſe whoſe ſtomacks are corrupt; and the higher and fuller the nutriment is, the more corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth it breed in thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and not apt to receive it. So it is in this ſacred ſpiritual repaſt; the greater and more large ſtock of ſpirits and ſtrength it is apt to afford to a ſoul that fits it ſelf to receive it; the more diſtempers and weakneſſes
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:31853:238"/>doth it leave in the ſpirit of him that cares not what he does, ſo he may but have it. Let me wiſh therefore every man to approve himſelf to be a ſincere Chriſtian, and ſo let him eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup; for as the benefits are great if we uſe it aright, ſo are the dangers great if we mind not what we do. Preſume not to draw nigh hither in your dirty garments. Let not your ſouls ſtand in Gods preſence all naſty and filthy. Lay not unwaſhen hands upon his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and let not your feet tread in his holy place, unleſs they walk in the ways of his Commandments. Let not him whoſe mouth is full of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and bitterneſs, of blaſphemies and revilings, of corrupt and rotten Communication, dare to put this bread into his mouth. Let not him that ſits with the drunkard, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in ſtrong drink, be ſo bold as to take this Cup into his hand. Let not the covetous Miſer that huggs his Mammon, be ſo fearleſs as to come to the Feaſt of charity.

Let not that hand ſtretch forth it ſelf to receive the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, which is dipt in Blood, or defiled with unlawfull gain. Let every man that works iniquity, and lives in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of any-known duty, or is not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to know it, fear and ſtand in awe, and keep at a diſtance, and inſtantly flie from his ſin which muſt thus make him avoid the preſence of the Lord, and the ſociety of the faithfull. Yea let not the moſt holy perſon dare to draw near to God in this duty, till he hath trimmed and dreſſed up his Soul; till he hath ſnuffed his Lamp, and made it burn more clearly; till he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited thoſe affections in his heart which are moſt proper to this action; till he hath conſidered what he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do, and hath put himſelf in a meet diſpoſition to be ſo familiar with God. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though he hath ſome goodneſs in him that comes unprepared to the Lords Table, yet he is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord. So the Apoſtle ſaith the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.27, 29.</note> who profeſſed the faith of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:31853:239"/>cauſe they did not diſcern the Lords Body, nor minded for what ends they did communicate. He offers a great diſreſpect to the body and bloud of Chriſt, and is guilty of irreverence to it, who makes not ſolemn and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous addreſſes to him, and comes with no mote purity and cleanneſs into the preſence of the King, then he would take care of, in the preſence of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man. He makes as if Chriſt was his fellow, and that a man may come as rudely into his company, as if he was coming: into his own houſe, and ſitting at his own board.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A good man that eats unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly, and without foregoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, may eat and drink damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> he may bring upon himſelf bodily judgments when he minds not ſeriouſly the religious ends of this eating and drinking. For ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is to be underſtood as it relates to the believing <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> as is manifeſt from <hi>v.</hi> 30. For this cauſe many were weak, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſick, and others were dead. The cauſe he ſpeaks of, was their unworthy eating and drinking. <hi>i. e.</hi>
                     <pb n="414" facs="tcp:31853:240"/>their maintaining pride and contempt of their poor brethren, their uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs and want of love even when they were doing this ſacred action. This cauſed God to ſcourge them, and inflict ſome puniſhments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their bodies, that he might awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſave their ſouls. Every ſin may be the cauſe of diſeaſes, but this in particular is noted as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thoſe diſeaſes that rage amongo Chriſtians. Take heed then how thou comeſt void of humility, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs, or not attendingl what thou art there to do; He that drinks thus unworthily, may have a poiſon run through his. veins; The Wine may breed the Stone in his kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys or bladder, and the Gout in his joynts; An Ague or Feaver may have commiſſion to invade his Bloudd Or if none of theſe fall upon him, it may bring a curfe upon his goods, or relations, or good name. Every time thou receiveſt, and art not a man that examines thy ſelf, for any thing thou canſt tell, thou killeſts a Child, or beaſt, thou blaſteſt thy Corn, or calleſt for Worms and Catterpillars
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:31853:240"/>upon thy fruit. And if we go on, and will not amend in this thing, whereas God doth now plague us with many ſickneſſes, he may in a ſhort time ſend the Peſtilence, and ſweep us away with the beſome of deſtruction; he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate our Pariſhes, and leave but a few Concommicants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for a wicked prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that approaches hither with ſome ſlight intentions to leave his ſin in which perhaps he the laſt week lived; He is guilty of the body and bloud of the, Lord in another ſenſe. He is a kind of murtherer of the Lord of life; He makes his Wounds bleed afreſh; and he pierces his ſides with a greater cruelty then the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier, he grieves and wounds him more then the <hi>Jems</hi> that wrung his bloud out of his ſacred Body. For he brings that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him which he hates more then he did death, more then the Nails and the Croſs. He pricks him with that which is ſorer to him then the Spear which was thruſt into his ſide. He knows he ſhould do better, when they did they knew not what. O how doth it trouble the heart of our
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:31853:241"/>Lord to ſee men lay that in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and cheriſh its life, which was the cauſe of his death. Yea, how grievous muſt it be unto him to ſee them do this, even when they come to commemorate his Death! This ſin of unworthy receiving, doth ſtrike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt to his heart, ſeeing all his pains cannot make them leave their ſins. It is as if a Child ſhould kiſs the bloody knife which killed his Father; When he comes to make a ſolemn declamation againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of his Death, and pretends to take vengeance upon them as villains, for ſuch an unpardonable fact. As if a <hi>Roman</hi> ſhould have run into the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Camp, having made a large commendation of that act of <hi>Decius</hi> in dying for his Countrey. And there is one ſin that ſeems more manifeſtly than others, to open the cloſed Wounds of Chriſt, that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and enmity in our hearts, which I doubt few of the common fort are free of. He that comes with his heart full of paſſion, and anger, and rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Brother, what doth he but rend and tear the body of Chriſt in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:31853:241"/>pieces? He ſeparates and divides as much as he can one part of it from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and in a moſt formal manner kills him afreſh in his members, who are called his Body. Whoſoever hates his brother, is a murtherer; whoſoever divides one man from another, he doth what he can to rend the body of Chriſt, and to deſtroy that which is as dear to him as his life. Now whoſe heart would not faint and ſwound to think of being guilty of his moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred blood? There is no ſuch load to the Conſcience, as to ſhed innocent blood: Who then can have a heart ſtrong enough to bear him up of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of the body and blood of the Son of God?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And that is the fourth thing; I would have ſuch perſons to conſider; that they eat and drink damnation to themſelves in a more ſpiritual ſenſe than the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did; that is, they make themſelves liable not onely to the plagues of God in this life, but to his everlaſting anger in the world to come. You have ſeen already that in this Sacrament we make a ſolemn profeſſion of our ſelves to be Chriſts
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:31853:242"/>Diſciples, we vow our ſelves to his ſervice; what doth he then but call for all the curſes of God upon his head, who takes no care to keep thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. We here profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, and to ſubmit our ſelves to it; now the threatnings of Chriſt are a part of his Goſpel, which we chuſe here to fall under, if we do not obey his commands. We here receive Chriſt who is repreſented to us by the ſigns of Bread and Wine. He therefore who embraces him with a dead faith which works not by love, what doth he elſe but damn himſelf. He profeſſes Chriſt as ſolemnly as any Creature can do, but he lives not according to him: His own faith then and belief, will condemn him. And let that man think that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from the Lords Table expoſed to all the miſchiefs in the world that can fall upon a man unprotected from above. The ſhadow of the Lord is departed from his head, and he lies open to all the Thunderbolts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And beſide he conſigns himſelf over to eternal death; he binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to endure the torments of Hell fire.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:31853:242"/>When a man can think of Chriſt, of his death, of his love, and yet love his ſin, and keep the traytor in his breſt; it will at laſt prove a traytor to him, and hale him to the moſt fear-full execution. The flames of Hell will be the hotter, becauſe the blood of Chriſt will not quench them: The Anger of God will be more incenſed, becauſe men blew it up by their ſins, notwithſtanding the ſtream of Blood which flowed from the ſide of his Son to ſlake it. And you will ſee that he is in greater danger of Hell fire then other men, and that he drinks damnation, if you conſider that which follows.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such a prophane perſon doth by this act more harden his heart in his ſin, and makes it more obdurate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the methods of God. It may be in the heart of ſome to ſay, that there is no ſuch danger of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for a man may repent, and though he do not now leave his ſin, yet hereafter he may be out of love with it. But this imagination will ſoon fly away, if you ſet but the light of this truth (and thoſe that follow) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:31853:243"/>it, That a mans heart becomes more obſtinate and unmalleable, who is not ſoftned by Chriſts Bloud, and goes on in ſin, though he then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps entertained ſome reſolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. This Bread will turn into a ſtone in ſuch a mans heart, and it will become as hard as the nether Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. He that can ſin, though he remember often ſuch a love that is in Chriſt, and ſo great evil as is in ſin, and though he come and make engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and profeſſions of love to him, muſt needs be very ſtupid and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. And God withdrawing his Grace, Chriſt departing away from ſuch an unhallowed and impudent Creature, muſt needs make his heart more ſeared, and his condition more dangerous. When he approaches to a ſoul, and finds it a neſt of unclean Birds, he will take the wings of a Dove and flie away to a cleaner and whiter habitation. Or rather, if we refuſe to hear his Law, and obey his Word which is preached to us, he will not come to us when we are ſo bold as to take this Covenant into our mouths, and yet hate to be reformed.
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:31853:243"/>And if he will not come to us, what can follow but coldneſs and hardneſs, by reaſon of his abſence?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Devil enters into that heart which Chriſt leaves. If the Lord can find no room in us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fit for ſeven more foul ſpirits than dwelt in us before. God leaves men more to the power of Satan when they offer ſuch contempt unto his Son. The powers of darkneſs ruſh with greater fury, and with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter throng upon ſuch a perſon that loves to be in darkneſs in the midſt of ſuch Heavenly light. The Serpent may infuſe his venome more into their ſpirits, as well as ſting their bodies, and he gets a ſtronger title to them after they have offered ſuch an affront and mockery to the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It muſt needs be hard for ſuch a perſon to get a pardon, becauſe he ſins even againſt that Bloud by which the pardon is to be obtained. Upon what ſcore can he ſue for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, who made ſo light of the Covenant of forgiveneſs? What will he plead for himſelf, who makes ſo little Conſcience of keeping
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:31853:244"/>Chriſt commands, that he breaks them all at once? for he that doth not receive Chriſt when he is ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and ſubmits not himſelf to him, he refuſes all the Goſpel, and rejects all that he ſays. I tell you, it will coſt a man many a tear, and a very ſad repentance, before he obtain the mercy to wipe off thoſe ſtains which the Blood of Chriſt leaves upon the Soul. He muſt be waſhed in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blood which he uſes ſo irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and which he can ſin againſt ſo boldly; and what a ſtrong faith muſt he have that can think this ſo eaſily to be obtained? Let no man then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach hither that is in love with any ſin, whoſe heart is not ſo broken for his Rebellions, that he verily thinks in his Conſcience he ſhall leave them. Let him bring nothing into the preſence of Chriſt which his Soul hates, unleſs he intend to be worſe then a <hi>Jew,</hi> who did not own him to be the Chriſt. And if any man do find upon good conſideration that he and his ſins are ſo ſaln out, that they ſhall never agree again, and therefore deſires here to make an open
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:31853:244"/>defiance of them, and joyn himſelf moſt ſolemnly in a friendſhip with Chriſt, let him be infinitely careful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that he do not return with a Dog to his vomit after he hath eaten this ſacred food.</p>
                  <p>But let me add this, that I do not ſay all this of the danger that is in this thing, that <hi>you may not come</hi> (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>but that you may not meerly come.</hi>

As he may ſurfeit and kill himſelf, that is a glutton, ſo it is moſt certain that he periſhes who faſts and never eats at all. If it be a duty to do this, then there is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment annexed to the neglect, as well as to the ill-performance of it. There is a danger in not coming, as well as in coming unworthily. God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at one ſin as well as at another; and if he ſhall be condemned that doth this ignorantly, or in love to his ſins, or in a half hatred of them, ſo ſhall he be that ſtays away, and will not get knowledge, nor leave his ſins. He that eats irreverently, is guilty by
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:31853:245"/>prophaning of Chriſts Body, and ſo is he that eats not at all, by deſpiſing of it, and preferring his luſts before him. As the one eats damnation to himſelf, ſo doth the other by not eating, judge himſelf to be in a damnable condition. For if we cannot partake of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per here, how can we think our ſelves fit to feaſt with him hereafter. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think that they are ſafe if they venture not upon theſe holy things; and it diſquiets them to come in their fins, but it never troubles them that they ſtay away and continue in their ſins. Theſe mens Conſciences are but half informed, and I ſeriouſly wiſh them not to endure in that condition, wherein they judge themſelves unmeet ſociety for Chriſt and the faithfull. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that you not onely live in ſin, but add this ſin to all the reſt, that you do not come to remember Chriſt, and ſhew forth his Death.

Do not weep and mourn, and afflict your Souls for a day, do not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your ſins for a little time, that you may entertain them afterward with a greater kindneſs, but give them an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal divorce, and bid them never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again. Do not go a little back from your ſins, that you may take your riſe, and leap into them with a greater violence; but fly from them as from the Devil, and the mouth of the pit, reſolving never to caſt a friendly look upon them any more. And then come to Chriſt, and cauſe joy in Heaven at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of a repenting ſinner. And if thou takeſt upon thee his yoke, why ſhould there not be joy on earth too? why ſhouldſt thou not come and praiſe the Lord for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thee, and make the faithfull rejoyce with thee that they have got more company at this holy Feaſt?</p>
                  <p>But I am very ignorant, will ſome ſay, and I dare not come for fear I underſtand not theſe myſteries. I anſwer, That it is very well if thou art ſenſible of thy ignorance, for then there is hope thou wilt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:31853:246"/>after knowledge. And it is not hard to underſtand the meaning of theſe things, but very eaſie; for our Lord hath made his ſufferings ſenſible to us in theſe ſigns, that we might more eaſily remember them, and be more quickly moved by them to due affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him.</p>
                  <p>But I am affraid my heart is not right, ſaith another, and that I am cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſhadows of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Let that man who ſpeaks thus, tell himſelf what he means by true faith which he would find in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Is it a perſwaſion that God loves thee? Is it a reſting on Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? A thouſand to one this is the miſtake which troubles many. But that Faith is another thing which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſpeaks of, which will be ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, if thou underſtandeſt what the Goſpel is which thou art to believe. The Goſpel is to be conſidered either as a Narrative, relation and report of what Chriſt Jeſus was upon earth, and of what he hath done, and ſuffered; of what he taught, and what he now is in the Heavens. It is an Hiſtory of his Life and Death, Reſurrection, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:31853:247"/>into Heaven, there to ſit at Gods right hand; and it is a Sermon concerning Chriſts Doctrines, of his commands, promiſes and threatnings. Or ſecondly, it is to be conſidered as it is a call or proclamation, an offer or tender of pardon, grace and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all that will accept of them on the conditions that they are propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now Faith is firſt an <hi>aſsent</hi> of the mind and heart to that report, a firm perſwaſion that all is true that is ſaid in the Goſpel; and ſecondly, It is a <hi>conſent</hi> to that offer, an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that invitation, an embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that is there tendred, by yielding up of our ſelves to obey the Lord Jeſus in all things. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt, this is believing in the Son of God. And there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acts of faith to be in thy heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou canſt lay hold of the mercy of God. And proportionably to thy ſincere and hearty conſent to obey him, will be thy perſwaſion of an intereſt in that mercy. If thy confident relying on him for ſalvation, exceed other acts of a lively faith, it is to be ſuſpected of too ſudden a growth, and thou hadſt
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:31853:247"/>beſt fear that it ſtarts up too high. But conſider with thy ſelf, doeſt thou believe the Goſpel? doth thy heart ſubmit to that way of ſalvation there propoſed? art thou devoted to the ſervice of Jeſus? Then be of good comfort, if not confident; come and ſtrengthen thy faith, that thou maiſt ſtill do as thou haſt reſolved. This is one of the commands of the Goſpel, that thou doſt believe; and therefore if thy faith be true, obey it.</p>
                  <p>But a third ſaith, That he hath ſo much buſineſs that he cannot prepare himſelf. But conſider I pray you in the fear of God, what greater buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can there be, than to work out our ſalvation? Had not they buſineſs (as they pretended) of great import, to whom the Lord ſaid, you ſhall not taſte of my Supper? Conſider whether thou canſt not bring thy buſineſs into a leſs compaſs, or may it not be let alone till another time? I cannot believe that any man is ſo imployed, that conſtantly when he is to receive the Sacrament, he muſt omit it, or be a great loſer. It is incredible that his buſineſs muſt be done juſt in that nick of time, and that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:31853:248"/>none elſe will ſerve. But how comes it that men can find time for ſports and recreations, for viſits and friendly entertainments; and yet can never be found at leiſure when Chriſt comes? And beſides, what do men mean by preparation? Are they ſo imployed that they cannot read, nor pray ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor praiſe God for his mercies? If they be, they are moſt dangerouſly buſied; it were good for them they had not half that riches which will not let them go to Heaven. But if they be conſtantly free for ſuch good duties, then they are making a daily prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this ſort of Prayers and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>There is none need be unprepared by buſineſs for this duty, who are not unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there are wicked perſons, that Communicate, ſay ſome other. Theſe it ſeems have time enough both to obſerve themſelves and others alſo. Then, I hope, they have reproved and admoniſhed their brethren, and they pray continually for them, or elſe why do they ſpeak of them as ſo wicked. None is to be deemed ſo wicked as to be excluded from our ſociety, unleſs he
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:31853:248"/>refuſe reproofs, and reject our good counſel, and withſtand all the means of amendment. But who made thee a judge of the matter? Canſt thou deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine who are fit to be debar'd all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſociety? If it belong to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon to judge of him, do not take upon thee his office. If he do not do his office, go and tell him of it; and if he ſtill neglect his duty, do not thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neglect thine. If he will not do what becomes him, do not thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuſe thine own food, and ſtarve thy Soul out of I know not what pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, that all things cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy deſire.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps this caſe may be thought worthy of particular ſatisfaction, and therefore I ſhall beſtow an whole Chapter upon it. This onely I deſire, that none would make it a matter of quarrel, which I propound, but look upon it as a deſire after peace.</p>

                  <p>ANd firſt, I ſuppoſe every ſober Chriſtian will take this for a truth, that no man is to judge another

                  <p n="2">II. Secondly, I think this will not be denied neither, that they in whoſe power it is to remove the wicked from Communion, are not to do it haſtily. Two or three thoughts will ſerve ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny private men to the refuſing of their Brethren. Some paſſionate diſcourſe ſhall convert them to ſeparate from all thoſe whom an hour before they own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

But then they that are judges, muſt take great heed that their zeal do not out-run their knowledge; and they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware they uſe not ſevere medicines, when more mild and gentle will cure the diſeaſe. Is God haſty in judging
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:31853:249"/>of us? Doth one ſin make him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his grace? Doth not he wait to be gracious? and is he not ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of great mercy? Doth not he uſe many means to amend us, before he ſends ſickneſſes or ſuch puniſhments upon us? The Miniſters of the Goſpel are then to imitate their Maſter, and to proceed very ſlowly unto any ſharp courſes, though they tend to mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Thirdly, We muſt take therefore the method which Chriſt hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, before we judge a man ſo wicked as to be unchurched. And that is this,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is an expreſs command for <hi>fraternal admonition,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14. Every particular Chriſtian that ſees his Brother in a fault, is bound to admoniſh him, to open his eyes, to awaken him our of his drowſineſs, and ſtir him up to repentance. It was a barbarous ſaying of <hi>Cain,</hi> Am I my Brothers keeper? If we be Brethren, we ought to have a charity to each other; and none can be greater than this, to reprove a ſinner, and endeavour his amendment. And ſo our Saviour bids every Diſciple (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15.) when his Brother treſpaſſes
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:31853:250"/>againſt him, that he ſhould go and tell him of it privately between them two. What a great deal would the Devil loſe, if this were practiſed as faithfully as many other duties are? Nay, if men were as ready to reprove, as they are to condemn, his Kingdome would be in danger to be ruined. For not only thoſe quarrels that are in the Church might be hereby reconciled; but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noiſome part of mans life would be ſanctified and perfumed. Their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings, their evil ſurmiſings, their whiſperings, and ſpeaking evil one of another, would at once be amended, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their uncharitable ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And I would to God that they who have ſuch a care that there ſhould be no wicked in the Church, would not tell others that ſuch a man is wicked, before they have told him ſo, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured his reformation. This would be a great charity to him, by hiding his faults from being more publick; and no leſs charity to our ſelves, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting a ſinner from the error of his wayes, and ſaving a ſoul from death, which will hide a multitude of ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If this prevail not, he is to get two
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:31853:250"/>or three honeſt men beſide himſelf, to do this duty with him. So our Saviour preſcribes in that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.16. We muſt not preſently give a man up for incorrigible, if our ſingle admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not received or followed; nor muſt we divulge his faults, and ſpread them any further than is neceſſary for his amendment. And perhaps the fault may be known to more than one; in which eaſe they that are of beſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and affections, ſhould undertake his cure, and cover his ſin that it be not known unto all men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But if he refuſe to hearken to theſe mens good counſell, then let them tell it to the Miniſter, whom God hath ſet over them, and let him privately admoniſh him that hath offended, with all love and gentleneſs. And as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was a <hi>fraternal,</hi> ſo is this a <hi>paternal</hi> admonition. And if his fault be known to him before, then he is bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him, both as he is a <hi>Brother,</hi> and as he is a <hi>Father.</hi> And I ſuppoſe his charity will be ſo great, as not to think one entreaty to be enough, but he will extend it to repeated beſeechings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any courſe more ſevere be uſed.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:31853:251"/>Or he may take, after many admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome few with him to be both wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of what he doth, and alſo to make it more ſolemn and effectual to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But then if after this ſort of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, the party continue unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>he must be rebuked before all,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. For as the private perſon was to do it by himſelf, and then before others; ſo is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter likewiſe to uſe a firſt and ſecond admonition anſwerable unto theirs. He is in the face of the Congregation to exhort him to repentance, to pray for him that he may repent, which in all likelihood will amend him, or at leaſt <hi>dum unus corripitur, plurimi emendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> many will fear the like correction. He that ſaith this is to defame a man, doth himſelf defame Goſpel, and finds fault with the method of Chriſt to do men good. He doth ſhame himſelf, <hi>qui facit, quod argui debet, non ille, qui arguit.</hi> He that reproves another, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame him, but he defames himſelf by deſerving of reproof. And it is a greater ſhame to commit it, and continue in it, than to be reproved for it, and amend it.</p>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:31853:251"/>
                  <p n="5">5. And if after theſe two admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his and theirs, he do not amend, then let him be rejected and caſt from the Communion of the Church, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>i. e.</hi> Let him ſpeak to all the Congregation to avoid ſuch a man as an infectious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and not keep ſociety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him. Let him charge them to withdraw themſelves from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and not to maintain familiarity with one ſo incorrigible. For you muſt know (which people little conſider) That they that you will not hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with at the Lords Table, you are not to hold converſe with at your own. Now what a deſperate ſinner muſt he be, that we would thus uſe? and how long ſhould we wait before this ſeverity be exerciſed? And yet we cannot ſatisfie our ſelves (as far as my weak underſtanding can judge) in abſtaining from his communion till this courſe have been taken with him. And let me ſay it with as much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as it hath truth on its ſide, <hi>That the way of the Church of God hath not been to gather the godly from among the prophane without any more ado, but to
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:31853:252"/>caſt out the prophane from among the godly, after all this labour.</hi> Believe it, corrupt Members are of the body, till they be cut off; And no wiſe man will uſe ſuch a ſharp remedy, till he ſees it will gangrene and indanger the body. He muſt firſt uſe corroding and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plaiſters, ſharp reproofs and mild admonitions. But without any of theſe, to ſuppoſe men ungodly, and gather a ſelect number out of them, is a path which the People of God have not trod, a practice which they have not been acquainted withall. I confeſs the crime may ſometime be ſo great, that all theſe courſes are not to be taken, but an Adulterer, a Fornicator, or ſuch like, is to be debar'd Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion without this proceſs, till he have given ſufficient proof of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. But becauſe we live in <hi>Faece Romuli,</hi> and there is little order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, let me ſuppoſe that they to whom it belongs, do not do their duty, and take this courſe. Yet</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Fourthly, Let it be conſidered, both that it is no part of thy duty to judg concerning the ſtate of other men, and that thou canſt not anſwer the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:31853:252"/>neglect of thy duty becauſe other men neglect theirs. Chriſt bids thee to do this in remembrance of him; if others will not do it ſo as they ought, that is no juſt cauſe for thee not to do it. How can another mans ſin be a reaſon for thy ſin? Why ſhould his not being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, be a cauſe of thy removing thy ſelf? If the Miniſter do not his duty in every thing, do thou do thine, or elſe you are both alike. He is negligent in not admoniſhing of them that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and thou art negligent in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of Chriſts Death, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt to be admoniſhed alſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Fifthly, Let it be conſidered alſo, that when thou doſt receive, thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is with the reſt of the Church, and not with him that receives not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. He only eats the Bread, and drinks the Wine, but receives not Chriſt, and ſo thou doſt not become one with him. All the communion thou haſt with him, is only <hi>natural,</hi> not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nor ſpiritual. His bodily preſence is there; and as to eating and drinking, thou doſt as he doth; but when thou conſidereſt the manner of the action, which is the morality of it, thou doſt
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:31853:253"/>not communicate with him, nor doſt what he doth. For thou doſt all in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort, for other ends and deſigns than he doth, ſo that in a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is no communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you. And then why ſhouldeſt thou ſever thy ſelf from communion with the body, for fear thou ſhouldeſt have communion with a ſinner, which thou canſt not have?</p>
                  <p n="6">IV. Sixthly, But if thou feareſt that his bodily preſence will do thee any harm, why mayeſt thou not as well think that thy bodily preſence will do him good? Thy goodneſs may as much avail him, as his ſin infect thee. You have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon each other (as to harm or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit) both alike, and that is none at all.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Seventhly, But perhaps you fear that your preſence with him is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of his ſin, and you ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to allow his vices. Theſe are meer fears and groundleſs jealouſies; for there is no man that doth ſo interpret it. It cannot ſignifie ſo much, unleſs the Congregation ſo underſtand it, which no wiſe man will do. And if you cannot be otherwiſe ſatisfied, go to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and profeſs to him, and as many
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:31853:253"/>of the Congregation as you pleaſe, that you diſlike the wayes of ſuch a perſon, and diſallow of the ſins wherein he lives, and that you intend not to have any communion with him, though he be preſent with you.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Eighthly, And if you fear that the ſinner himſelf will make an ill uſe of it, and think himſelf to be good, becauſe he is in good company, you have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy at hand for that, which is private admonition and reproof. And I deſire thoſe that are ſo ſcrupulous, ſeriouſly to conſider whether they have by good counſell and advice, laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this ſinfull Neighbour. If not, then what hypocriſie is it to complain of mixt communions, and that he is there, when thou haſt not done what thou canſt to hinder it by making of him better? He that ſaith he cannot with any comfort partake with ſuch a perſon, ſhould rather conſider with what comfort he can live in the ſinfull neglect of ſuch a plain duty, as that is, of admoniſhing his Brother. It is the part of a Chriſtian not to condemn his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to labour to make him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Not to refuſe communion with him
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:31853:254"/>preſently, but to aſſociate himſelf with him, to perſwade him to amend.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Ninthly, But if thou haſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this duty carefully, then he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preſume thou loveſt his ſin, though thou loveſt him; nor will any ſin which he afterward commits, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to thy neglect; nor will the ſin of his receiving unworthily be laid to thy charge, becauſe thou didſt what thou couldſt to prevent it. It can only be matter of thy compaſſion and ſorrow, but not thy burden and trouble, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother doth not do his duty when thou haſt done thine. And all Gods Servants in all ages of the Church, have received comfort in ſuch mixed communions, and have patiently waited till Chriſts courſe was taken with men for their reformation. And it is to be feared that ſuch objectors ſeek for too much comfort in outward things, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort themſelves in their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; <hi>Whereas their true comfort lyes in doing of their duty faithfully to God and to their Brethren, and in the mercy of God in Chriſt.</hi> And if they look for other comfort, they will be deceived, for the net of the Goſpel brings both
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:31853:254"/>good and bad to the ſhore; and where there is Wheat, there are Tares many times alſo.</p>
                  <p>Let no man therefore plead this or that in excuſe for his not coming to the Lords Table, but reſolve hereafter carefully to perform ſo neceſſary a duty. Let the ſinner quit his ſtate of ſin and death, and ſo come and eat of the Bread of life. Let the ignorant come into the School of Chriſt, and proceed till they come to the higheſt form, to the upper room where this Feaſt is prepared. Let thoſe that are in enmity with their Neighbours alſo come; let them only firſt go and be reconciled to their Brethren, and ſo let them offer their gift. Let thoſe that have a multitude of worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come, only let them leave them as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his Aſſes at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Mount, and ſo let them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to Heaven in their thoughts, and converſe with God. Let the weak come that they may grow in ſtrength, and let the ſtrong come that they may not grow weak. Let them who have fears come, that their hearts may be ſetled by the acts of a more lively faith; and let
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:31853:255"/>them come who have hopes that they may riſe to greater degrees of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confidence. Let thoſe who have leiſure accept of this invitation, becauſe they have no excuſe; and let thoſe who have but little leiſure entertain it alſo, that they may the more ſanctifie their buſineſs and employments; let the ſad and ſorrowfull, approach, that their hearts may be filled with the joys of the Lord; and let thoſe that rejoyce in the Lord alwayes, approach, that their joy may be full. Do not ſend your excuſes when you are called, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that a neceſſity lyes upon you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will be guilty of the fouleſt neglect of your duty, and the greateſt diſreſpect to Gods love. If any man can be content to ſtay away after all theſe entreaties, on to come but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome when he may be ſo welcome; Let him conſider what a wrong he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to his own ſoul, how he robs it of its food and nouriſhment, and how he pineth the moſt noble and excellent Creature in the world. And let him conſider what an affront it is to God to deſpiſe the choiſeſt of his chear, the moſt coſtly proviſion made by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:31853:255"/>of his Sons Bloud, and the moſt kind and gracious invitations to it. O fooliſh people and unwiſe! do we thus requite the Lord? do we thus ſlight the dying of our Saviour? are we no more affected with his ſingular love? Is this to commemorate the death of Chriſt, to come once or twice in a year to this Feaſt? <hi>The Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon us, and help us.</hi> How are we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from the primitive practiſe? how cold is our love to God and to his Son grown? Unleſs we blow it up by a frequent remembrance of Chriſt, it is to be feared it will quite go out. The aſhes and duſt of this world will bury all the remaining ſparks of it which are not yet extinguiſhed. Let Chriſt, I beſeech you, ſee that you love him, by taking all occaſions to come to him; by binding your ſelves faſter with the cords of his love, to all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and dutifulneſs toward him. And let me but tell you theſe two truths, and I ſhall put an end to this Diſcourſe: <hi>The way to have reformed us would not have been to leave off Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, but to make them more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Nor ſecondly, To unite and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:31853:256"/>conſolidate Pariſhes, but to make more Paſtors in greater Pariſhes, that by more perſonal inſtruction men might be better fitted for frequent Communion.</hi> But ſo it is, that zeal oft-times hath too much paſſion in it, and too little knowledge. The good Lord pardon us, and be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto us.</p>
